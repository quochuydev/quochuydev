Demo apps for Upwork jobs.

# Overview

We build the prototypes UI for client in the Upwork.

# Rules

- Next.js app router
- Deploy in Vercel
- App router `/apps/[upworkJobId]/*`
- API routes `/api/apps/[upworkJobId]/*`
- Database prisma sqlite
- CSS Tailwind Shadcn
- `./components/ui/` Shadcn components
- Not separate component by app, each app code component in page.
- Use fetch to call API.
- Don't install any extra packages, until we brainstormed for the feature.
