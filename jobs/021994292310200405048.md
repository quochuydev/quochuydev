Summary
I’m working on a project called Infinity Force — it’s an NFT marketplace platform that’s already in the MVP stage. The base version is done, but it still needs a lot of polish and final touches to get it ready for launch.
I had one developer working on it, but honestly, his skill level was too junior for what this project needs, so we had to part ways. Now I’m looking for a strong blockchain/full-stack dev who can pick up where things left off and finish the job right.
The MVP is already working — users can mint, list, buy, and sell NFTs. Wallet connections (MetaMask, WalletConnect) are in place, and the UI is built in React / Next.js. But I still need help improving smart contracts, cleaning up the backend, fixing bugs, and getting everything ready for mainnet.
Before hiring, I’ll need to test your skills — just a small practical task to see how you handle the code and logic. Nothing crazy, just want to make sure you’re comfortable with the stack.

Here’s the tech stack we’re using:
~ Solidity, Web3.js / Ethers.js
~ React / Next.js
~ Node.js / MongoDB
~ IPFS (for NFT storage)

If you’re confident with those and have experience building NFT platforms or Web3 apps, I’d love to chat.
This is an ongoing project, not a from-scratch build, so you’ll be working with an existing codebase. I’m easy to work with as long as communication is clear and progress is steady.
