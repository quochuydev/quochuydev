## Client's Upwork job description

We are a fast-growing US telehealth company. Our marketing relies heavily on SEO, landing pages, and fast experimentation.
We need to ship pages fast, scale content production, and build an architecture that can handle 100–300+ pages without slowing down.

Current Problem

Our website is on WordPress + Elementor.

This setup is too slow, too fragile, and impossible to scale:

- Building ONE page takes too long.
- Elementor is heavy and slow.
- The site performance degrades as we add more pages.
- No way to automate page generation or use AI.
- Difficult to run experiments, A/B tests, or deploy updates fast.
- At 100, 200, 300 pages → WordPress collapses.

We need to move to a Next.js + CMS architecture that is light, fast, and AI-friendly.

What We Want to Build

We are not building “just a website.”
We are building a content factory for rapid SEO and landing page creation.

You must be experienced in:

- Next.js 13/14 (App Router, ISR, SSG)
- Sanity / Contentful / Headless WordPress
- TailwindCSS
- SEO-friendly development
- Performance optimization (must know Core Web Vitals deeply)
- Building scalable component systems
- Deployment on Vercel

Bonus:

- Experience integrating AI (Gemini, GPT) into dev flows
- Experience building programmatic/templated landing pages
- Experience migrating high-traffic WP → Next.js sites

Your Responsibilities

- Architect the new Next.js blog
- Set up CMS + all content models
- Import existing WordPress posts properly
- Rebuild templates (post, blog listing, category pages)
- Implement perfect SEO parity
- Integrate analytics, FB Pixel, Intercom scripts, etc.
- Deliver clean documentation + SOPs

Help us build automation hooks for AI-generated pages.

Who We’re Looking For:

- Senior-level engineer only
- Fast, proactive, communicative
- Someone who can think like an architect, not just a coder
- Someone who cares about performance and SEO
- Someone comfortable working with founders directly

## My cover letter

Hi,

I have 7 years building production web applications, and here's how I would approach your migration:

1. **Next.js architecture is straightforward.** I've built SEO-optimized sites with App Router, ISR, and SSG. The key is proper setup from the start—routing strategy, image optimization, and metadata management for 300+ pages without performance degradation.

2. **CMS integration is easy.** I've worked with headless CMS systems and can set up Sanity or Contentful with proper content models. WordPress migration requires careful URL mapping and metadata preservation to maintain SEO parity.

3. **Performance optimization is essential.** I understand Core Web Vitals deeply—LCP, CLS, FID. I use Lighthouse, WebPageTest, and Vercel Analytics to measure and optimize. TailwindCSS + proper code splitting keeps bundles small at scale.

4. **AI integration for content generation is the future.** I'm currently building an AI coding platform with LLM integrations. I can help set up automation hooks for programmatic page generation using Gemini or GPT.

5. **Analytics and third-party scripts need careful handling.** I know how to implement FB Pixel, Intercom, and analytics without killing performance—lazy loading, proper script strategies, and testing impact on Core Web Vitals.

Throughout the project, I'll report progress frequently, deliver clean documentation and SOPs. I can also help set up monitoring and A/B testing infrastructure.

Available to start immediately.

Best,
Huy Pham
