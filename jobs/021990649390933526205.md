We are a real estate and construction–focused company building a next-generation online platform that combines the best parts of:

Zillow – home search and lead sales to real estate agents
HomeAdvisor – lead generation and resale to contractors
Yelp – business directory and customer reviews
Houzz – 3D design, contractor connection, and material sales

Our goal is to connect homeowners and property owners with contractors, designers, architects, engineers, realtors, and loan officers on a single platform.
Important (Platform Rule):
All communication and payments for this project must stay inside this platform.
Do not share or request email, phone, WhatsApp, social media, or any other external contact.
Proposals that try to move the conversation off-platform will be ignored and declined.

What We’re Building (High-Level Modules)
You will help design and build, in phases, a platform with:

1. Consumer Accounts (User & Homeowner)
   Two consumer roles with different access and pricing (User, Homeowner).
   Home listing and address verification.
   Cloud storage area for property documents.
   Ability to connect with service providers.
   Product / materials e-commerce (online store).
   Property search (buy/rent) similar to Zillow.
   3D home design tool using real construction materials and furniture.
   Access to games, podcasts, and online classes with quizzes and certificates.
   Architecture designed to be AI-compatible and self-learning ready.

2. Service Provider Platform
   Membership tiers with different access and pricing, for example:
   Workforce – workers looking for jobs and visibility.
   Pro – established businesses with full profiles, ability to bid on projects, buy homeowner leads, and connect with others.
   Hero – higher tier with ability to post projects, receive bids, and access a Project Finder tool.
   Realtors & Loan Officers – specialized memberships with CRM setup, bonus leads, and visibility to consumer users.
   Core service-provider features:
   Business directory with public profiles and ratings/reviews (Yelp-style).
   Project Finder – live feed of construction projects from permit data, searchable by contractors.
   Ability to post projects and receive bids from other contractors (GCs and subs).

3. CRM & Marketing Tools (Platform + Admin)
