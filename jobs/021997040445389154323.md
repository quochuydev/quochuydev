## Client's Upwork job description

Skup is looking for a talented, confident, and seasoned senior software engineer to bring our AI project from proof-of-concept to production-grade software

—

Skup is an eCommerce Coaching and Training company that delivers world-class education and training alongside ever-evolving AI tools and software to accelerate eCommerce operational success

Currently, we have a tool in an infantile stage that is primed to be developed and grown into our next in-house premier software project, and we seek a highly experienced engineer to head up the direction and development of this project

The project is a React & Node.js web application with barebones LLM integration established, running within a Docker Compose project, and utilising BullMQ for queued jobs.

What is needed is comprehensive LLM integration development, implementation of prompt chaining via queued jobs, and implementation of management of said prompt chains under a given instance (e.g. an “app” is comprised of a series of prompts chained together)

Expected milestones to be delivered (high level descriptions for post brevity):

- Database Schema Finalized
- Admin API for resource ("Apps") CRUD and management, and user/billing management
- Basic API (via User interaction) for "App" execution and profile management
- Credit system implemented (dependent on Apps development and Database schema)
- Billing integration using native/dynamic Payment Software adapter (i.e. processing billing via Stripe or Authorize.net, etc)
- App Execution Functionality (e.g. User loads "app" instance and executes with specified inputs)
- 3rd Party LLMs integrated with primary APIs to accomplish appropriate AI tasks (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini)

Consider this the MVP version

You are a great candidate for this position if you have:

- A passion for coding!
- Pride in your work
- Great communication
- High interest in AI-related projects
- Mild PTSD from wrestling with prompt engineering

Requirements we’re looking for - apply if you hit most of these

- More than eight years of software development experience in a professional environment, working on and delivering production-grade software
- More than five years of experience working with Node.js and React
- High proficiency in TypeScript
- High proficiency in Database design and architecture, using one of the following: MySQL, Postgres
- High proficiency in working within a Linux environment and overseeing code deployments
- Three or more years of Docker experience (preferably Compose and/or Swarm)
- Experience working on native integrations directly using AI platforms (LLMs primarily), including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini - preferably projects that are deployed in a user-facing environment
- Expert knowledge about data structures
- Experience with queueing systems
- Experience using Redis

Some nice to haves:

- Proficiency with frontend state frameworks (e.g. RTK, Zustand)
- Proficiency with frontend API layer frameworks (e.g. RTK Query, React Query)
- Proficiency with UI Form State management libraries (e.g. react-hook-form)
- Experience using BullMQ

This project is practically a green field project. It will require someone that is thoughtful, meticulous, and dedicated to their craft. We are not building vaporware, but rather building for the future of AI in eCommerce. If you want to be considered then begin your post with #SkupGang and tell us about your most recent deployed bug and how you addressed it :)

## My cover letter

#SkupGang

Hi,

My most recent deployed bug was a BullMQ race condition where parallel prompt chains overwrote each other's context. Fixed it with Redis-based locking and job sequencing.

I have 7 years of production experience, and here's how I would approach your project:

1. Database schema is straightforward: I've designed schemas for multi-tenant SaaS platforms with user management, billing, and resource tracking. The key is keeping it simple while supporting future scale.

2. LLM integration with prompt chaining is my specialty: I'm building an AI coding platform with workflow pipelines that chain prompts together. I understand how to manage context, handle failures, and optimize costs across OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini.

3. Credit systems and billing are easy: I've built payment systems with Stripe, PayPal, and Braintree for U.S. and European markets. Webhook handling, credit tracking, and usage management are solved problems.

4. Admin dashboards provide valuable insights: I can help you visualize user activity, LLM costs, and system health with proper monitoring.

5. Docker and deployment are simple: I deploy to Kubernetes and manage Docker Compose environments. I can also set up CI/CD pipelines and production monitoring at no extra cost.

Throughout the project, I'll report progress frequently and deliver clean documentation. I'll also provide long-term support after completion.

Available to start immediately.

Best,
Huy Pham
