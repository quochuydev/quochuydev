- Create responsive chart layout compatible with desktop & mobile
- Connect chart to data source (from API)
- Implement real-time updates

## **2. Core Chart Features**

- **MACD** (MACD line, signal line, histogram)
- **Stochastic Oscillator** (%K, %D)
  All indicators must:

- update when timeframe/data changes
- be visually styled clearly
- sync with main candlestick chart

## **4. Buy/Sell Markers (Auto-Generated)**

- Implement **buy markers** (green arrow / circle)
- Implement **sell markers** (red arrow / circle)
- Markers must appear based on data from API
- Markers should snap to correct candle coordinate

## **5. Drawing Tools (User Interaction)**

- Horizontal line tool
- Rectangular zone tool (for support/resistance or supply/demand)
  With these requirements:
- draggable anchors
- deletion option
- save drawings to localStorage (optional)

- **Trendline Auto-Placement** (optional but recommended)
- Algorithm-generated default trendline
- **Support & Resistance Auto Zones** (optional)

## **7. Chart Performance & Stability**

- Smooth rendering even on 5+ years of data
