## Client's Upwork job description

Summary
I’m building a parent site called PortraitAI with several themed pages

Customers upload a photo, choose a theme, pay, and receive an AI-generated portrait.

I need a full-stack developer who can build the backend to connect:

Responsibilities:

Build API endpoints to:

receive upload + theme selection

create a Stripe Checkout session

process Stripe webhooks

call AI image generation APIs

store final images and notify users

Set up Supabase (or preferred backend):

Database tables (orders, images, themes)

Storage for input/output images

Serverless functions for automation

Integrate the Squarespace form with the backend

Deliver email with finished portraits (Postmark/SendGrid/Resend)

Optional: connect to Printful/Printify for automatic print fulfillment

Requirements:

Proficiency with Supabase or similar serverless stack

Experience with Stripe Checkout + Webhooks

Experience with AI Image APIs (OpenAI, Stability, Replicate)

Strong in Node.js OR Python

SQL/Postgres knowledge

Experience integrating with low-code platforms (Squarespace/Webflow)

Excellent communication and clear documentation

Deliverables:

Fully working backend

One theme completed (90s Yearbook Dogs)

Ability to add new themes easily via database

Working demonstration end-to-end

Clear instructions for future expansion

## My cover letter

Hi,

I see you need a serverless backend connecting Squarespace to Stripe, AI image generation, and automated email delivery - that's exactly the type of payment-to-AI workflow I've built multiple times.

I've been a full-stack developer since 2018, specializing in Node.js backend APIs with payment integration and AI services. Your tech stack (Supabase, Stripe webhooks, AI APIs) matches my recent projects perfectly.

Relevant Experience:

- Built payment integration with Stripe, PayPal, and Braintree for BidBid dating app serving 10,000+ daily users
- Developed serverless APIs on AWS/GCP/Firebase handling automated workflows between payment processing and third-party services
- Implemented AI agent platform using LangChain/LlamaIndex with OpenAI/Claude APIs for automated content generation
- Architected microservices with PostgreSQL, message queues (RabbitMQ/NATS), and Docker/Kubernetes deployment

I've worked extensively with Gemini APIs and Claude APIs for automated content generation. For your portrait generation workflow, I can implement a robust pipeline that handles payment confirmation, triggers AI generation, and delivers results via email - all with proper error handling and retry logic.

Deliverables I can provide:

- Complete Supabase backend with database schema, storage, and Edge Functions for all workflows
- Stripe Checkout + webhook handlers with proper idempotency and error recovery
- AI image generation pipeline with fallback handling and automatic email delivery via SendGrid/Resend
- Theme management system allowing easy database-driven theme additions
- Full documentation and deployment guide for future expansion

Available for a call this week to discuss technical architecture and timeline. I can start immediately.

Best,
Huy Pham
