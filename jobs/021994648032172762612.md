Summary
I’m building a parent site called PortraitAI with several themed pages

Customers upload a photo, choose a theme, pay, and receive an AI-generated portrait.

I need a full-stack developer who can build the backend to connect:

Frontend (Squarespace) → Backend API (Supabase or Node) → Stripe → AI Image API → Email Delivery

Responsibilities:

Build API endpoints to:

receive upload + theme selection

create a Stripe Checkout session

process Stripe webhooks

call AI image generation APIs

store final images and notify users

Set up Supabase (or preferred backend):

Database tables (orders, images, themes)

Storage for input/output images

Serverless functions for automation

Integrate the Squarespace form with the backend

Deliver email with finished portraits (Postmark/SendGrid/Resend)

Optional: connect to Printful/Printify for automatic print fulfillment

Requirements:

Proficiency with Supabase or similar serverless stack

Experience with Stripe Checkout + Webhooks

Experience with AI Image APIs (OpenAI, Stability, Replicate)

Strong in Node.js OR Python

SQL/Postgres knowledge

Experience integrating with low-code platforms (Squarespace/Webflow)

Excellent communication and clear documentation

Deliverables:

Fully working backend

One theme completed (90s Yearbook Dogs)

Ability to add new themes easily via database

Working demonstration end-to-end

Clear instructions for future expansion
