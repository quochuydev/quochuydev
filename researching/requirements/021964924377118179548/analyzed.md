### Solution Proposal

#### Problem Statement

The client requires a Shopify application to automate the tedious process of generating new product entries for sofa textiles. Currently, this task involves manually updating Excel spreadsheets and then inputting data into Shopify for each product, which is inefficient and prone to errors. Additionally, they want to streamline the image creation for products by overlaying their textiles on clients' sofas, enhancing the visualization for prospective buyers.

#### Proposed Solution

1. **Automated Product Creation**

   - Implement a function that generates new product entries directly in Shopify, utilizing the Shopify Admin API.
   - The app will allow users to input key attributes such as:
     - Product name
     - Product description
     - Size variants
     - Color variants
     - Image links

2. **Image Generation**

   - Integrate an image processing library to allow dynamic composition of images, where the clients' sofas can be layered with the new textiles. Suggested libraries include:
     - **Canvas** (JavaScript)
     - **Pillow** (Python)
     - **Sharp** (Node.js)
   - Allow users to upload or link their sofa images, which the system will overlay with the selected textile image.

3. **User Interface**

   - Develop a user-friendly UI within Shopify using Polaris components, so users can easily interact with the app.
   - Create a step-by-step wizard to guide users through the product creation process, ensuring they can input all necessary product information seamlessly.

4. **Data Validation and Error Handling**
   - Ensure appropriate validation for user inputs at every step (e.g., ensuring image links are valid, product names are unique).
   - Implement comprehensive error handling to manage API requests and provide clear feedback to users.

### Next Steps and Responsibilities

1. **Kick-off Meeting**: Schedule a meeting with the client to refine requirements, clarify any ambiguities, and finalize the scope of work.
2. **Project Planning**: Develop a project timeline with milestones for major deliverables, including interface design, backend development, testing, and deployment.
3. **Prototype Development**: Create an initial prototype focusing on the product creation workflow.
4. **Image Processing Implementation**: Develop and integrate the image generation functionality.
5. **Testing Phase**: Conduct thorough testing (unit, integration, and user acceptance testing) to ensure reliability and usability.
6. **Deployment**: Deploy the application and provide documentation and training materials for the client.
