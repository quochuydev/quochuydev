The Draw.io XML has been successfully converted to YAML format! Here's what was accomplished:

## Conversion Summary

The XML diagram has been transformed into a structured YAML file with:

**5 Bounded Contexts:**
1. **PO Creation and Approval Flow** - Handles initial PO creation and approval routing
2. **PO Approval Decision Flow** - Manages approval/rejection decisions  
3. **PO Resubmission Flow** - Handles rejected PO resubmissions
4. **Payment and Finance Flow** - Manages payment processing
5. **Audit and Cancellation Flow** - Handles PO cancellations

**25 Total Elements** categorized by type:
- **3 Actors** (Requester, Approver, Finance Staff)
- **6 Events** (PO Created, Approval Granted, etc.)
- **7 Commands** (Create Purchase Order, Approve PO, etc.)
- **3 Policies** (validation and authority rules)
- **3 Read Models** (dashboards and reports)
- **3 External Systems** (email, vendor systems)

**Key Features Preserved:**
- Original element positioning coordinates
- Unique node IDs for traceability
- Complete flow relationships and connections
- Color-based type classification
- Hierarchical structure (contexts → flows → nodes/edges)

The YAML maintains all the semantic meaning and relationships from the original Draw.io diagram while providing a more structured, machine-readable format that's easier to process programmatically or convert to other formats.
