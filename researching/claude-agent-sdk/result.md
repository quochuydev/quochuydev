I need permission to use the Draw.io tools to create your EventStorming diagram. Could you please grant me access to the Draw.io MCP tools?

Once you grant permission, I'll create a comprehensive EventStorming diagram that includes:

1. **Read Models** - Dashboard views for Requesters and Approvers, PO details, and audit trails
2. **Actors** - Requester, Approver, and Finance roles
3. **Commands** - PO creation, submission, approval/rejection, resubmission, cancellation, and payment recording
4. **Policies** - Business rules governing PO creation, approval workflow, payment processing, and cancellation
5. **Events** - Domain events like PO Created, Submitted for Approval, Approved, Rejected, etc.
6. **Flows** - Complete workflows showing how Requesters create POs, Approvers review them, and the resubmission process

The diagram will visually map out your expense approval domain showing how all these elements interact in a clear EventStorming format.
