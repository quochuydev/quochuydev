He works as a cautious businessman in a counting-house in London, living alone in gloomy chambers formerly owned by his deceased partner Marley, with whom he co-owned the firm Scrooge and Marley. Scrooge is characterized by his frosty demeanor, reflected in his physical features such as a pointed nose, shriveled cheek, and wiry chin, and by his dismissive attitude toward warmth, human sympathy, and social gatherings. He is notably tight-fisted, controlling resources like coal for heating with extreme frugality, and is famously disdainful of Christmas, often calling it \"\"Humbug.\"\" His nephew Fred and employee Bob Cratchit frequently encounter his harsh views and miserly behavior, which cast a dark shadow over their Christmas celebrations.\n\nInitially, Scrooge is portrayed as a man who is unsympathetic toward the poor, refusing to donate to charitable causes and indifferent to the suffering of others. He is regarded as the \"\"Ogre\"\" of his family, estranged from social warmth and generosity, and prefers isolation, warning others to keep their distance. His past reveals a lonely and neglected childhood, and through supernatural visitations, he reflects on his youth, including happier times such as his apprenticeship under the kindly Fezziwig, which contrasts sharply with his current greed and avarice.\n\nThe story’s pivotal moments occur when Scrooge is visited by the ghost of his former business partner Marley and subsequently by three spirits: the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Yet to Come. These supernatural visitations force Scrooge to confront his life, choices, and impending fate. He witnesses scenes from his own past, present hardships faced by the Cratchit family—especially the frail Tiny Tim—and a bleak vision of his lonely death. These experiences evoke deep emotional reflections and a profound moral and spiritual transformation.\n\nBy the end of the story, Scrooge undergoes a remarkable change of heart. He becomes generous, caring, and joyful, embracing the spirit of Christmas. He shows kindness by inviting his nephew Fred to dinner, raising Bob Cratchit's salary, and anonymously sending a large turkey to the Cratchit household. Scrooge’s transformation is marked by his newfound commitment to living by principles of generosity and kindness, ultimately becoming a beloved figure who keeps Christmas well and cares deeply for others, especially Tiny Tim.\n\nIn summary, Ebenezer Scrooge is a complex character who evolves from a miserly, cold-hearted man into a warm, generous individual through supernatural intervention and self-reflection, embodying themes of redemption, compassion, and the true spirit of Christmas.\",105\n39,CHRISTMAS EVE,\"Christmas Eve is the time setting of the scene, described as a cold, bleak, and foggy day.
