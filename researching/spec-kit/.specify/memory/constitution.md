# Project Development Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality Standards
- **Readability First**: Code should be self-documenting with clear naming conventions and consistent formatting.
- **Modular Design**: Components should be loosely coupled and highly cohesive, following the Single Responsibility Principle.
- **Code Reviews**: All code changes require peer review before merging to main branches.
- **Technical Debt**: Document and track technical debt; include remediation plans in the project backlog.
- **Documentation**: Maintain up-to-date API documentation, inline comments for complex logic, and clear README files.

### III. User Experience Consistency
- **Design System**: Adhere to a centralized design system for UI components and patterns.
- **Accessibility**: Meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards for all user interfaces.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure consistent experience across all device sizes and platforms.
- **Internationalization**: Support multiple languages and regional formats from the start.
- **Error Handling**: Provide clear, actionable error messages and graceful degradation.

### IV. Performance Requirements
- **Load Time**: First Contentful Paint < 1.5s, Time to Interactive < 3s on mid-tier devices.
- **Scalability**: Design for horizontal scaling; handle 2x current peak load with graceful degradation.
- **Resource Usage**: Optimize memory and CPU usage; implement proper resource cleanup.
- **Monitoring**: Implement real-time performance monitoring with alerting for critical thresholds.
- **Caching Strategy**: Implement appropriate caching layers (browser, CDN, application, database).

## Development Workflow

### V. Version Control
- **Branching Strategy**: Follow GitFlow or GitHub Flow methodology.
- **Commit Messages**: Use conventional commits with clear, descriptive messages.
- **Pull Requests**: Require at least one approval before merging; all CI checks must pass.

### VI. Continuous Integration/Deployment
- **Automated Builds**: All code changes trigger automated builds and tests.
- **Deployment Pipeline**: Automated deployments through staging to production with manual approval gates.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: All infrastructure must be versioned and deployed through code.

## Security & Compliance

### VII. Security Practices
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Regular dependency and container scanning.
- **Authentication/Authorization**: Implement OAuth 2.0 with proper scopes and permissions.
- **Data Protection**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.
- **Security Headers**: Implement security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.) for web applications.

### VIII. Compliance Requirements
- **GDPR/CCPA**: Implement data protection and user privacy controls.
- **Logging**: Maintain audit logs for all critical operations.
- **Documentation**: Keep security and compliance documentation up to date.

## Governance

### IX. Decision Making
- **Architecture Decisions**: Document significant decisions using ADRs (Architecture Decision Records).
- **Technical Debt**: Regular reviews and prioritization of technical debt items.
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Regular tech talks, documentation updates, and pair programming.

### X. Continuous Improvement
- **Retrospectives**: Hold regular retrospectives to identify improvement areas.
- **Metrics**: Track and review key metrics (deployment frequency, lead time, change failure rate, MTTR).
- **Learning**: Dedicate time for team learning and skill development.

## Compliance & Amendments
- This constitution supersedes all other development practices and standards.
- Amendments require:
  - Documented proposal with rationale
  - Team review and approval
  - Version update and changelog entry
  - Communication to all stakeholders
