## Rules

- Event's name must be passive voice
- Command's name must be action and a user's role

## Types

- ðŸ”µ Command: Action and a user's role, Example: `CreateOrder (User)`
- ðŸŸ  Event: Passive voice, Example: `OrderCreated`
- ðŸŸ£ Policy: Business rule, often a condition
- ðŸŸ¢ Read model: Input data
- ðŸŸ¡ Sub process (a process that often repeat, start with an ðŸŸ  Event)
- ðŸ”´ External: External system, what we can't control
