## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-01

- Q: Authentication Method (NFR-008): Email/password, SSO integration, or OAuth providers? ‚Üí A: Authentication not required in MVP stage
- Q: Notification Channels (FR-031): Email only, in-app notifications, SMS, or multi-channel? ‚Üí A: In-app notification
- Q: Feedback Workflow (FR-033): Can approvers request changes, or only approve/reject? ‚Üí A: Rejected requests must be resubmitted; feedback saved as draft cannot change approval status
- Q: Project Budget Allocation (FR-025): How do projects relate to departments? Can expenses be split across projects? ‚Üí A: Projects can be shared between departments or stay within 1 department; each expense linked to exactly 1 project
- Q: Dashboard Time Period (FR-038): Monthly, quarterly, or yearly views for budget utilization? ‚Üí A: Quarterly data
- Q: Data Retention Period (NFR-005): Legal requirement for audit log retention (assumed 7 years)? ‚Üí A: 2-year retention period
- Q: Encryption Standards (NFR-007): Specific compliance requirements (SOC2, ISO 27001)? ‚Üí A: Sensitive data defined in detail and encrypted following OWASP Top 10 standard
- Q: Receipt Extraction Failure (Edge Case): Manual entry fallback when OCR fails? ‚Üí A: Manual input required
- Q: Budget at exact limit: How system handles requests when department budget exactly equals current spend? ‚Üí A: No escalation occurs for manager-approved requests
- Q: Approver unavailability: Workflow for vacation/sick leave? ‚Üí A: Delegation should be configured for each user in case of vacation
- Q: Mid-month budget changes: Impact on pending requests when budget modified? ‚Üí A: New budget impacts pending-on-approval requests and requests created after budget change date
- Q: Employee departure: Handling of pending requests when creator leaves company? ‚Üí A: When deactivating a user, delegation is required
- Q: OCR integration approach for MVP? ‚Üí A: Mock OCR data in MVP; real integration deferred to deployment phase

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

An SME company (5-50 employees) needs to manage cash flow through budget tracking and expense management. Employees submit expense requests with receipts, which flow through configurable approval chains based on amount, category, and department budget. Department heads and management monitor budget utilization while finance teams maintain audit trails. The system makes management more efficient, proactive, and less complex while optimizing resource utilization.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** an employee needs to purchase supplies, **When** they create an expense request with receipt attachment, **Then** the system extracts receipt data (provider, amount, items) and routes the request to their manager for approval

2. **Given** a manager receives an expense request under 20,000,000 VND within department budget, **When** they approve it, **Then** the request goes to finance for final approval without requiring CEO review

3. **Given** a finance team member reviews approved expenses, **When** they access the audit trail, **Then** they see immutable history of all approvals, changes, and timestamps with user identification

4. **Given** a department head plans quarterly spending, **When** they define department budget allocations, **Then** future expense requests validate against available budget before approval routing

5. **Given** a CEO needs to fast-track an urgent expense, **When** they approve any submitted request, **Then** the request completes immediately regardless of configured approval chain

6. **Given** an expense request exceeds department monthly budget, **When** it enters approval workflow, **Then** the system routes it to CEO for approval even if amount is under 20,000,000 VND

### Edge Cases

- When receipt image is unclear or unreadable, system requires manual input of expense data by requestor
- When expense request submitted at exact department budget limit, no escalation to CEO occurs for manager-approved requests
- When approver unavailable (vacation, sick leave), system uses delegation configured for that user
- When department budget modified mid-month, new budget applies to pending-on-approval requests and new requests created after change date
- When expense is rejected with feedback, requestor must resubmit as new request; feedback can be saved as draft but does not change approval status
- When employee leaves company, user deactivation requires delegation configuration for pending requests
