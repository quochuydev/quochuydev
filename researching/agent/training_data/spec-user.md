## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session

- Q: Authentication Method: Email/password, SSO integration, or OAuth providers? ‚Üí A: Authentication not required in MVP stage; predefined accounts used
- Q: Password Policy: Complexity requirements, expiration, reset workflow? ‚Üí A: Deferred to post-MVP; MVP uses predefined accounts without passwords
- Q: User Self-Service: Can users update their own profiles or request department changes? ‚Üí A: Users can update basic profile fields (name, contact); + department changes require Manager or CEO approval
- Q: Bulk User Operations: Import/export users, batch role assignments? ‚Üí A: Single user operations only in MVP; bulk operations deferred
- Q: Multi-Department Assignment: How to handle users in multiple departments? ‚Üí A: Users can be assigned to multiple departments with one designated as + primary
- Q: Delegation Limitations: Can delegation be limited to specific approval types or all responsibilities? ‚Üí A: Delegation transfers all approval + responsibilities for specified time period
- Q: Deactivation vs Deletion: Are user accounts deleted or deactivated? ‚Üí A: Users are deactivated only; no deletion to preserve audit trail integrity
- Q: Session Management: Concurrent login limits, session timeout? ‚Üí A: Deferred to post-MVP with authentication implementation
- Q: User Search & Filtering: Required search capabilities for admin operations? ‚Üí A: Search by name, email, department, role; filter by status + (active/inactive)

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

An organization needs to manage user access to the system with role-based permissions. Admin users create and manage
user accounts, assign roles and organizational units, and configure delegation for absence periods. Users update their own profiles while managers oversee organizational unit
assignments. The system ensures proper access control, maintains audit trails of user changes, and supports organizational hierarchy for approval workflows.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** an Admin user needs to onboard a new member, **When** they create a user account with role and organizational unit assignment, **Then** the system
   generates an active account accessible by the new member
2. **Given** a user is going on leave, **When** they configure delegation to a colleague for a specified date range, **Then** all responsibilities
   automatically transfer to the delegate during that period
3. **Given** a manager needs to view team members, **When** they access the user directory, **Then** they see all users in their organizational unit with roles,
   contact information, and current status
4. **Given** a user leaves the organization, **When** an Admin user deactivates the account, **Then** the system requires delegation configuration if
   pending responsibilities exist and preserves all historical data
5. **Given** an Admin reorganizes organizational units, **When** they reassign users to different units, **Then** the system updates workflows and access
   accordingly while logging all changes
6. **Given** a user updates their profile information, **When** they change contact details or display name, **Then** changes take effect immediately
   without requiring approval
7. **Given** an Admin user searches for users, **When** they filter by organizational unit and active status, **Then** the system displays matching users with
   relevant details

### Edge Cases

- When user assigned to multiple organizational units, system uses primary unit designation for access validation
- When delegation configured with overlapping date ranges, most recent delegation configuration takes precedence
- When deactivating user with active delegations, system cancels all outgoing delegations and preserves incoming delegation records
- When delegate is also deactivated during delegation period, system reverts responsibilities to original user
- When user role changed from higher to lower privilege level, system removes elevated permissions but preserves historical records
- When last Admin user would be deactivated, system prevents deactivation to maintain administrative access
