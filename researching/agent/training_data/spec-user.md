# Feature Specification: User Management System

**Feature Branch**: `user-management`

**Created**: 2025-10-03

**Status**: Draft

**Input**: User description: "Create user management specification with role-based access control, organizational structure, and delegation capabilities"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
    ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
    ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
    ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
    ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
    ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
    ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
    ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
    ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session

- Q: Authentication Method: Email/password, SSO integration, or OAuth providers? ‚Üí A: Authentication not required in MVP stage; predefined accounts used
- Q: Password Policy: Complexity requirements, expiration, reset workflow? ‚Üí A: Deferred to post-MVP; MVP uses predefined accounts without passwords
- Q: User Self-Service: Can users update their own profiles or request group changes? ‚Üí A: Users can update basic profile fields (name, contact); group changes need Manager or Admin approval
- Q: Bulk User Operations: Import/export users, batch role assignments? ‚Üí A: Single user operations only in MVP; bulk operations later
- Q: Multi-Group Assignment: How to handle users in multiple groups? ‚Üí A: Users can be in multiple groups with one set as primary
- Q: Delegation Limitations: Can delegation be limited to specific types or all responsibilities? ‚Üí A: Delegation transfers all responsibilities for set time period
- Q: Deactivation vs Deletion: Are user accounts deleted or deactivated? ‚Üí A: Users are deactivated only; no deletion to keep history
- Q: Session Management: Concurrent login limits, session timeout? ‚Üí A: Will be added post-MVP with authentication
- Q: User Search & Filtering: Required search capabilities for admin operations? ‚Üí A: Search by name, email, group, role; filter by status (active/inactive)

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

An organization needs to control who can access the system and what they can do. Admin users create accounts, assign roles and groups, and set up delegation when users are away. Users can update their own profiles. Managers can see their team members. The system tracks all changes and supports team structure for approvals.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** an Admin needs to add a new member, **When** they create a user account with role and group, **Then** the system creates an active account the new member can use
2. **Given** a user is going on leave, **When** they set up delegation to a colleague for a date range, **Then** all tasks move to the delegate during that time
3. **Given** a manager needs to view team members, **When** they open the user directory, **Then** they see all users in their group with roles, contact info, and status
4. **Given** a user leaves, **When** an Admin deactivates the account, **Then** the system asks for delegation setup if tasks are pending and keeps all history
5. **Given** an Admin reorganizes groups, **When** they move users to different groups, **Then** the system updates access and logs all changes
6. **Given** a user updates their profile, **When** they change contact details or name, **Then** changes happen right away without approval
7. **Given** an Admin searches for users, **When** they filter by group and status, **Then** the system shows matching users with details

### Edge Cases

- When user is in multiple groups, system uses primary group for access checks
- When delegation dates overlap, most recent setup wins
- When deactivating user with active delegations, system cancels outgoing delegations and keeps incoming ones
- When delegate is also deactivated during delegation time, system gives tasks back to original user
- When user role changes from higher to lower level, system removes extra permissions but keeps history
- When last Admin would be deactivated, system stops it to keep admin access

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### User Account Management

- **FR-001**: Admin users MUST be able to create new user accounts with email, name, role, and group assignment
- **FR-002**: System MUST support hierarchical role types with distinct permission levels (e.g., User, Manager, Admin, Super Admin)
- **FR-003**: System MUST initialize with predefined accounts for MVP with various role levels distributed across groups
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow Admin users to modify user roles and group assignments
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow users to update their own profile information including display name and contact details
- **FR-006**: System MUST prevent users from changing their own role or primary group assignment
- **FR-007**: System MUST validate email addresses are unique across all user accounts
- **FR-008**: System MUST prevent creation of duplicate user accounts with same email address

#### User Status

- **FR-009**: Admin users MUST be able to deactivate user accounts
- **FR-010**: System MUST prevent deletion of user accounts; only deactivation allowed to preserve audit trail
- **FR-011**: System MUST require delegation configuration when deactivating user account with pending responsibilities
- **FR-012**: System MUST prevent deactivation of last active Admin user in the system
- **FR-013**: System MUST allow Admin users to reactivate previously deactivated accounts
- **FR-014**: Deactivated users MUST NOT be able to access system or appear in active user lists
- **FR-015**: System MUST preserve all historical data and audit records for deactivated users

#### Role & Permission Management

- **FR-016**: User role MUST have permissions to: create/edit own resources, view own resources, update own profile, configure own delegation
- **FR-017**: Manager role MUST have User permissions plus: view group resources, approve requests within authority, view group members
- **FR-018**: Admin role MUST have permissions to: manage all users, manage system configurations, approve all requests, view all groups, access all reports
- **FR-019**: Super Admin role MUST have all Admin permissions plus: final authority on all requests, override any decision
- **FR-020**: System MUST enforce role-based permissions on all user actions
- **FR-021**: System MUST prevent privilege escalation through user interface or API access

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001**: System MUST provide response times under 200ms for user directory list views (per Performance Requirements principle)
- **NFR-002**: System MUST provide response times under 100ms for user interactions like role changes (per Performance Requirements principle)
- **NFR-003**: System MUST be accessible to screen readers and meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards (per User Experience Consistency principle)
- **NFR-004**: System MUST work on mobile devices and tablets with responsive design (per User Experience Consistency principle)
- **NFR-005**: System MUST maintain user audit logs for minimum 2 years
- **NFR-006**: System MUST support concurrent access by 50 users without performance degradation
- **NFR-007**: System MUST encrypt sensitive user data (email, contact information) following OWASP Top 10 security standards at rest and in transit
- **NFR-008**: MVP stage does not require authentication; users initialized with predefined accounts
- **NFR-009**: System MUST ensure data consistency for user operations across concurrent sessions

### Key Entities

- **User**: Person in the system with unique email, display name, role (User, Manager, Admin, Super Admin), primary group, other group memberships, contact info, active/inactive status, create time, and last update time
- **Role**: Permission set that defines access levels (User, Manager, Admin, Super Admin) with abilities to approve, manage users, configure system, and access reports
- **Permission**: Access rule for role that defines allowed actions (manage_users, approve_requests, configure_system, view_reports, etc.)
