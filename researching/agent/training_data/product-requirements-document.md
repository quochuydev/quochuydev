# Product Requirements Document
## User Management Web Application

**Document Version**: 1.0
**Created**: 2025-10-06
**Status**: Ready for Review
**Product Owner**: [To be assigned]
**Feature Branch**: 001-a-web-application

---

## Product Vision

To deliver a streamlined, secure web-based user management system that empowers organizational administrators to efficiently manage their workforce across departments and roles, while enabling all employees to maintain accurate personal information. This solution will serve as the foundation for organizational structure management, supporting effective team coordination and administrative oversight.

---

## Problem Statement

Organizations struggle with fragmented user management processes that lead to:

- **Administrative Burden**: Manual processes for onboarding, role assignment, and department transfers consume significant administrative time
- **Data Inconsistency**: Decentralized user information leads to outdated records and organizational confusion
- **Access Control Issues**: Lack of clear role-based permissions creates security vulnerabilities and compliance risks
- **Poor User Experience**: Employees cannot easily view or update their own information, leading to increased IT support tickets
- **Concurrent Update Conflicts**: Multiple administrators working simultaneously on user records create data corruption and lost updates

**Impact**: Organizations with 100-300 employees waste approximately 10-15 hours per week on manual user management tasks, with an estimated 20-30% of employee records containing outdated information at any given time.

---

## Business Objectives

1. **Reduce Administrative Overhead**: Decrease time spent on user management tasks by 60% through streamlined workflows
2. **Improve Data Accuracy**: Achieve 95%+ accuracy in employee records through self-service profile updates
3. **Enhance Security**: Implement role-based access control to ensure only authorized personnel can manage sensitive user data
4. **Enable Scalability**: Support organizational growth from startup to mid-size company (up to 300 employees)
5. **Prevent Data Loss**: Eliminate concurrent update conflicts through robust concurrency control mechanisms

## Functional Requirements

### FR-1: User Profile Management

**Description**: Administrators must be able to manage complete user lifecycle including creation, updates, and removal while ensuring data integrity.

**Priority**: Must Have

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- **AC-1-1**: GIVEN an administrator is authenticated, WHEN they access the user creation form, THEN they can input first name, last name, email, select a role from available roles, and assign a department (if role requires it)
- **AC-1-2**: GIVEN an administrator creates a user with Employee or Manager role, WHEN they submit the form, THEN the system requires department assignment before saving
- **AC-1-3**: GIVEN an administrator creates a user with CEO role, WHEN they submit the form, THEN the system allows submission without department assignment
- **AC-1-4**: GIVEN a valid user creation form is submitted, WHEN the save operation completes, THEN the new user appears in the user list within 1 second with all assigned attributes visible
- **AC-1-5**: GIVEN an administrator selects a user to edit, WHEN they access the edit form, THEN all fields (first name, last name, email, role, department) are editable
- **AC-1-6**: GIVEN an administrator updates user information, WHEN they save changes, THEN the updates persist and reflect immediately in all user listings
- **AC-1-7**: GIVEN an administrator initiates user deletion, WHEN they confirm the deletion, THEN the user is marked as deleted (soft delete) but all data is retained in the system
- **AC-1-8**: GIVEN a user is soft-deleted, WHEN administrators view user listings, THEN the deleted user does not appear in any list or search results
- **AC-1-9**: GIVEN an administrator views user profiles, WHEN they access the user list, THEN they can see all active users regardless of department or role
- **AC-1-10**: GIVEN each user account is created, WHEN the system assigns a role, THEN exactly one role must be assigned (no users without roles or multiple roles)

**Edge Cases**:
- What happens when an administrator tries to create a user with an email that belongs to a soft-deleted user? System displays error "Email address is already in use" and prevents creation (emails remain globally unique)
- What happens when an administrator attempts to remove the department from a Manager role user? System displays error "Users with Manager role must be assigned to a department" and prevents save
- What happens when the last CEO in the system is deleted? System allows deletion (no business rule preventing this scenario)

---

### FR-2: Self-Service Profile Updates

**Description**: Regular users must be able to view and update their own profile information to maintain data accuracy without administrator intervention.

**Priority**: Must Have

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- **AC-2-1**: GIVEN a regular user is authenticated, WHEN they access their profile page, THEN they can view their first name, last name, email, assigned role, and assigned department (read-only for role and department)
- **AC-2-2**: GIVEN a regular user edits their first name, WHEN they save the change, THEN the new first name is updated and visible immediately
- **AC-2-3**: GIVEN a regular user edits their last name, WHEN they save the change, THEN the new last name is updated and visible immediately
- **AC-2-4**: GIVEN a regular user edits their email address, WHEN they save the change, THEN the new email is updated and visible immediately
- **AC-2-5**: GIVEN a regular user attempts to modify their role, WHEN they access the edit form, THEN the role field is read-only and cannot be changed
- **AC-2-6**: GIVEN a regular user attempts to modify their department, WHEN they access the edit form, THEN the department field is read-only and cannot be changed
- **AC-2-7**: GIVEN a regular user tries to view another user's profile, WHEN they attempt to navigate to that profile, THEN the system displays HTTP 403 Forbidden error

**Edge Cases**:
- What happens when a regular user tries to change their email to one that already exists? System displays error "Email address is already in use" and prevents save (same validation as admin edits)
- What happens when a user edits their profile while an admin simultaneously edits the same user? System detects the conflict using optimistic locking, displays error "Profile was updated by another user", and requires refresh/retry

---

### FR-3: Department Management

**Description**: Administrators must be able to create, modify, and manage organizational departments to reflect company structure.

**Priority**: Must Have

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- **AC-3-1**: GIVEN an administrator is authenticated, WHEN they create a new department with a unique name, THEN the department is saved and becomes available for user assignment within 500 milliseconds
- **AC-3-2**: GIVEN an administrator edits a department name, WHEN they save the change, THEN the updated name appears in all department listings and user assignments
- **AC-3-3**: GIVEN an administrator attempts to delete a department with active users assigned, WHEN they confirm deletion, THEN the system displays error "Cannot delete department with active users assigned" and prevents deletion
- **AC-3-4**: GIVEN an administrator attempts to delete a department with only soft-deleted users, WHEN they confirm deletion, THEN the system allows deletion (soft delete)
- **AC-3-5**: GIVEN the system is initialized for the first time, WHEN the application starts, THEN three default departments are created: HR, IT, and Finance
- **AC-3-6**: GIVEN default departments are created at initialization, WHEN the seeding process completes, THEN each department has 1 manager user and 1 employee user assigned
- **AC-3-7**: GIVEN an administrator creates or edits a department, WHEN they enter a department name that already exists (case-insensitive), THEN the system displays error "Department name already exists" and prevents save
- **AC-3-8**: GIVEN an administrator views all departments, WHEN they access the department list, THEN they can see all active departments with user counts

**Edge Cases**:
- What happens when trying to delete a department with only soft-deleted users? System allows deletion (same soft-delete behavior as roles)
- What happens when an administrator changes the last manager in a department to an employee role? System allows the role change; administrator is responsible for ensuring departments have managers (business rule, not system-enforced)
- What happens when a department name contains only whitespace? System trims spaces and validates that result is not empty, displays error "Department name cannot be empty"
- What happens when creating a department with leading/trailing spaces? System trims spaces before validation and save

---

### FR-4: Role Management

**Description**: Administrators must be able to define and manage organizational roles including default and custom roles to support diverse organizational structures.

**Priority**: Must Have

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- **AC-4-1**: GIVEN the system is initialized for the first time, WHEN the application starts, THEN three default roles are created: Employee, Manager, and CEO

- **AC-4-3**: GIVEN the CEO user is created at initialization, WHEN the user account is saved, THEN admin privileges are automatically granted
- **AC-4-4**: GIVEN an administrator creates a custom role, WHEN they provide a unique role name, THEN the role is created and becomes available for user assignment within 500 milliseconds
- **AC-4-5**: GIVEN an administrator creates or edits a role, WHEN they optionally provide role description and role category (employee/manager), THEN these fields are saved with the role
- **AC-4-6**: GIVEN an administrator creates or edits a role, WHEN they enter a role name that already exists (case-insensitive), THEN the system displays error "Role name already exists" and prevents save
- **AC-4-7**: GIVEN an administrator edits a default role, WHEN they save changes, THEN the default role is updated (default roles are editable)
- **AC-4-8**: GIVEN an administrator attempts to delete a role assigned to active users, WHEN they confirm deletion, THEN the system displays error "Cannot delete role assigned to active users" and prevents deletion
- **AC-4-9**: GIVEN an administrator attempts to delete a role assigned only to soft-deleted users, WHEN they confirm deletion, THEN the system allows deletion (soft delete)
- **AC-4-10**: GIVEN an administrator views all roles, WHEN they access the role list, THEN they can see all active roles including default and custom roles with user counts
- **AC-4-11**: GIVEN an administrator enters a role name, WHEN the system validates the name, THEN only letters, numbers, and spaces are accepted
- **AC-4-12**: GIVEN an administrator enters a role name with leading/trailing spaces, WHEN the system processes the input, THEN spaces are trimmed before validation

**Edge Cases**:
- What happens when role name contains only whitespace or leading/trailing spaces? System trims spaces and validates that result is not empty, displays error "Role name cannot be empty"
- What happens when trying to delete a role that was previously assigned to deleted users? System allows deletion if role is not currently assigned to any active users
- How does system handle concurrent role updates? System uses optimistic locking to detect conflicts, displays error "Role was updated by another user"
- What happens when deleting the last role of a specific type? System allows deletion if role is not assigned to any active users (no restriction on role type)

---

- **AC-5-3**: GIVEN an administrator views the user list, WHEN they select a department filter (e.g., "HR"), THEN only users assigned to the selected department are displayed
- **AC-5-4**: GIVEN an administrator views the user list, WHEN they enter search text (name or email), THEN only users matching the search criteria are displayed
- **AC-5-5**: GIVEN an administrator applies multiple filters, WHEN they combine role, department, and search filters, THEN results match ALL applied criteria (AND logic)
- **AC-5-6**: GIVEN the user list contains up to 100 users, WHEN the page loads, THEN the complete list is rendered within 2 seconds

**Edge Cases**:
- What happens when a user list contains 100+ users? System must load within 2 seconds per performance requirements (pagination may be needed but not specified)

**Priority**: Must Have

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- **AC-6-1**: GIVEN a user submits a form with an email address, WHEN the system validates the email, THEN it must conform to RFC 5322 standard format
- **AC-6-2**: GIVEN a user submits a form, WHEN any required field is empty, THEN the system displays error "All required fields must be completed" and prevents save
- **AC-6-3**: GIVEN a user attempts to create or update a user account, WHEN they enter an email that already exists in the system (including soft-deleted users), THEN the system displays error "Email address is already in use" and prevents save
- **AC-6-4**: GIVEN a user creates or updates a user account, WHEN they select a role, THEN the system validates the role exists in the available roles list

- **AC-6-7**: GIVEN a user enters a last name, WHEN the length exceeds 100 characters, THEN the system displays error "Last name cannot exceed 100 characters" and prevents save
- **AC-6-8**: GIVEN a user enters a department name, WHEN the length exceeds 100 characters, THEN the system displays error "Department name cannot exceed 100 characters" and prevents save
- **AC-6-9**: GIVEN a user enters a department name, WHEN the name contains characters other than letters, numbers, and spaces, THEN the system displays error "Department name can only contain letters, numbers, and spaces" and prevents save
- **AC-6-10**: GIVEN a user enters text fields, WHEN the input contains leading or trailing spaces, THEN the system automatically trims spaces before validation and save

**Edge Cases**:
- What happens when email validation fails? System displays specific error message indicating email format is invalid (e.g., "Please enter a valid email address")
- What happens when multiple validation errors occur? System displays all validation errors simultaneously to user
- What happens when trimming spaces results in empty string? System treats as missing required field and displays appropriate error

---

### FR-7: Concurrency Control

**Description**: System must prevent data conflicts when multiple users edit the same records simultaneously.

**Priority**: Must Have

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- **AC-7-1**: GIVEN two administrators edit the same user simultaneously, WHEN the second administrator attempts to save, THEN the system detects the conflict with 100% accuracy

- **AC-7-3**: GIVEN a user encounters a concurrent edit conflict, WHEN they refresh the data, THEN they see the most recent version and can retry their edit
- **AC-7-4**: GIVEN optimistic locking is implemented, WHEN a record is read for editing, THEN the system captures a version identifier (timestamp or version number)
- **AC-7-5**: GIVEN a user saves changes, WHEN the system validates the update, THEN it compares the version identifier to detect conflicts
- **AC-7-6**: GIVEN two administrators edit the same role simultaneously, WHEN the second administrator attempts to save, THEN the system detects the conflict using optimistic locking
- **AC-7-7**: GIVEN two administrators edit the same department simultaneously, WHEN the second administrator attempts to save, THEN the system detects the conflict using optimistic locking
- **AC-7-8**: GIVEN a regular user and administrator edit the same user profile simultaneously, WHEN either attempts to save, THEN the system detects the conflict (same behavior for all user types)

**Edge Cases**:
- What happens when user edits their own profile while admin simultaneously edits same user? System detects conflict using optimistic locking and requires refresh/retry
- What happens when three users try to edit same record? First save succeeds, subsequent saves detect conflict and require refresh
- What happens when conflict occurs on deletion? System prevents deletion if record was updated since it was loaded for deletion

---

### FR-8: Authorization and Access Control

**Description**: System must enforce role-based access control to protect sensitive administrative functions.

**Priority**: Must Have

- **AC-8-3**: GIVEN a non-admin user attempts to access department management features, WHEN they navigate to the department management URL, THEN the system displays HTTP 403 Forbidden error page
- **AC-8-4**: GIVEN a regular user is authenticated, WHEN they access their own profile, THEN they can view and edit permitted fields only
- **AC-8-5**: GIVEN the system displays an error page, WHEN unauthorized access is attempted, THEN the error page is user-friendly and explains the access restriction

**Edge Cases**:
- What happens when user directly accesses admin URLs via browser? System validates permissions server-side and displays 403 error
- What happens when user session expires during admin operation? System redirects to login (authentication requirement not fully specified - see Open Questions)
- What happens when admin privileges are revoked while user is logged in? Next protected action validates current permissions and denies access if revoked

    .max(100, { message: "First name cannot exceed 100 characters" }),
  lastName: z.string()
    .trim()
    .min(1, { message: "Last name is required" })
    .max(100, { message: "Last name cannot exceed 100 characters" }),
  email: z.string()
    .email({ message: "Please enter a valid email address" })
    .refine(
      (email) => /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/.test(email),
      { message: "Email must conform to RFC 5322 standard" }
    ),
  roleId: z.string().uuid({ message: "Role must be selected" }),
  departmentId: z.string().uuid().nullable()
    .refine(
      (val, ctx) => {
        // CEO role can have null department, others cannot
        const role = ctx.parent.role; // Assumes role is populated
        if (role?.name === 'CEO') return true;

## Notes and Recommendations

### For Development Team

1. **Prioritize Clarifications**: Schedule stakeholder meeting to address all NEEDS CLARIFICATION items, particularly authentication mechanism (Q-1 to Q-3) which are blocking
2. **Design for Extension**: While authentication is out of current scope, design user model to accommodate future auth integration
3. **Implement Pagination Early**: Although not explicitly required, pagination will be necessary to maintain performance beyond 100 users
4. **Consider Soft Delete Archival**: Plan for future data archival strategy as soft-deleted records accumulate
5. **Build Comprehensive Test Suite**: High importance on 100% conflict detection accuracy requires robust concurrency testing
6. **Accessibility from Start**: Even without WCAG level specified, implement semantic HTML and ARIA attributes as best practice

### For Product Owner

1. **Schedule Clarification Session**: Address all open questions before committing to delivery timeline
2. **Plan Phased Rollout**: Consider pilot deployment with limited user group to validate assumptions
3. **Define Success Criteria**: Establish baseline metrics for current manual processes to measure improvement
4. **Review Compliance Needs**: Consult with legal/compliance team to determine regulatory requirements (Q-11)
5. **Consider Change Management**: Plan for user training and communication strategy for successful adoption

### For Quality Assurance

1. **Concurrency Testing Critical**: Develop automated tests for optimistic locking scenarios with multiple concurrent users
2. **Validation Coverage**: Create comprehensive test matrix for all validation rules across entities
3. **Performance Testing**: Establish performance testing baseline at 100, 200, and 300 user volumes
4. **Cross-Browser Testing**: Once browsers defined (Q-6), establish cross-browser test strategy
5. **Accessibility Testing**: Once WCAG level defined (Q-5), establish accessibility test plan

### For Stakeholders

1. **Review Open Questions**: Prioritize answering questions marked as "Critical" and "Important"
2. **Validate Assumptions**: Confirm assumptions section aligns with organizational reality
3. **Review Seed Data**: Validate default roles, departments, and user personas match organizational structure
4. **Plan for Growth**: Consider whether 300-user capacity is sufficient for 2-3 year horizon
5. **Security Review**: Engage security team to address encryption, audit logging, and compliance questions
