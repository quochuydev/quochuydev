### 1. Solution Proposal

**Problem Statement:**
The client requires a seamless wholesale customer experience on their Shopify store. Key challenges include managing wholesale customer login and accounts, configuring user permissions, and ensuring a tailored checkout process specific for wholesale clients. The solution should leverage Shopify’s native wholesale capabilities plus customizations to create an intuitive interface and smooth workflow.

**Proposed Solution:**

1. **Account Setup & Access Management**

   - Create separate wholesale customer accounts with login access.
   - Configure systems to differentiate wholesale accounts from retail accounts automatically.
   - Setup user roles and permissions for wholesale customers.

2. **Wholesale Pricing & Product Access**

   - Implement Shopify’s Wholesale Channel or Apps to set wholesale pricing.
   - Limit access to wholesale products or collections only to logged-in wholesale customers.

3. **Custom Wholesale Checkout**

   - Customize checkout flow to support wholesale conditions (e.g. minimum order quantities, payment terms).
   - Enable tailored tax and shipping settings for wholesale customers.

4. **User Experience (UX) Enhancements**

   - Design an intuitive wholesale customer dashboard for order history, reordering, and profile management.
   - Provide clear navigation toggling between retail and wholesale sections.

5. **Integration & Automation**

   - Automate approval workflow for new wholesale account applications.
   - Integrate with inventory and ERP systems if applicable, for real-time stock and order processing.

6. **Compliance & Security**
   - Ensure login and account management respects GDPR and data protection standards.
   - Secure user session and permissions strictly.

**Value to Business:**

- Boost wholesale sales through better client experience.
- Reduce manual account management efforts.
- Improve wholesale customer loyalty and ease of ordering.

**Next Steps and Responsibilities:**

- Schedule video call for detailed requirements and Shopify access.
