Summary
We need a Shopify app to help us speed up the work of generating new products.

We sell sofa textiles that replaces your current textile.

In order to showcase our clients our product we've find a unique way of generating pictures with the clients sofa on the top (500 px \*250 px) and the new textile on the bottom like the one attached to this description.

Until now we're doing a manual job in excel in order to first name the new product, then adding product description, size variants, color variants as well as a link to the image from within Shopify.

We'd like now to create a Shopify app that can do this for us!
