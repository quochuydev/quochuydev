# Technical Specification ‚Äî Web Builder Project

## üèóÔ∏è Technology Stack

### Framework

- **Next.js 14+ (App Router)**
  - Routing with `app/` directory
  - API routes via `app/api`
  - Server Components for data-fetching
  - Client Components for interactive UI

### Deployment

- **Vercel**
  - Preview deployments per branch
  - Production deployment on `main`
  - Environment variables managed in Vercel dashboard
  - Serverless edge functions for backend API routes

### Storage

- **Vercel Blob**
  - Store user-uploaded images, videos, documents
  - Blob URLs used in JSON config for rendering
  - API integration for upload and retrieval
  - Lifecycle policy: define expiry or permanent storage

### UI + Interaction

- **React-RND**
  - Wrapping components for resizing in the builder canvas
  - Configuration of `minWidth`, `maxWidth`, `aspectRatio`, `resizeHandles`
  - Snapping to grid system
  - Used only in **editor mode**, not in published site

### Styling

- **TailwindCSS**
  - Utility-first styling
  - Responsive breakpoints (`sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`)
  - Theme customization for colors and typography

### UI Library

- **shadcn/ui**
  - `Button`, `Card`, `Dialog`, `Form`, `Input`, `NavigationMenu`
  - Used to render standard building blocks in a consistent design system

## üöÄ Developer Notes

- Use **server actions** for mutations where possible
- Keep `page.json` in database (Postgres / Supabase / Prisma ORM)
- Store product files in **Vercel Blob** with metadata in DB
- Protect downloads: issue signed URLs with expiry
- For scalability: consider moving to AWS S3 + CloudFront later if needed
