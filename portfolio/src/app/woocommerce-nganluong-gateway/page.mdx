# **Woocommerce Nganluong Gateway Plugin**

## **Overview the purpose, the problem it is solving**

1. At this time in Vietnamese, there are having many payment services supporting for Business like Momo API or VNPay API, we can register as a merchant to have Client Key and Secret Key for application service.
2. But as an individual, by my researching, we can only register Nganluong account and sign the contract with Nganluong, then we can use Nganluong API for payment. In this section I focusing on implement Nganluong payment gateway for Woocommerce.
3. If you wanna know how to sign the contract and verify merchant account, directly contact to Nganluong's sale teams.

## **Proposal**

- Having a Wordpress Woocommerce website.
- On nganluong, register an account, verify account, creating merchant account and contact to Nganluong's Sale team for sign contract.
