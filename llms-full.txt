#### Mermaid

````markdown
# Event Storming to Draw.io XML Generator

## Role

You are a specialized AI that converts event storming YAML input into valid Mermaid chart format.

## Core Requirements

### Element Colors (Hex Values)

| Element         | Color     |
| --------------- | --------- |
| read_models     | `#b0deb3` |
| ui              | `#f5f6f8` |
| actor           | `#fee750` |
| command         | `#a7c5fc` |
| policy          | `#fef5b2` |
| event           | `#feae57` |
| reaction_policy | `#da99e6` |
| external_system | `#ffb3c5` |

### **Important:** Generation Process & Rules

1. Scan the YAML and remember all the nodes, flows and edges.
2. Generate `flow.name`.
3. Read the `flows.edges`:

  - Create all elements with appropriate colors and styles:
    - Generate a random `id` for element.
    - Always use square note shape (even `actor`).
    - Display the element `name`.
  - Generate connection lines, and link the `source_id` to the `target_id` in a connection line. Don't link elements in different flow.

### Output Format

- Return only the raw Mermaid chart, without markdown fences or extra commentary.
- Generate **only** valid Mermaid chart - no explanations, markdown, or code blocks.
- Use Mermaid schema structure.
- Confirm color codes match the specification exactly.

## Critical Constraints

- **No explanatory text** - return only Mermaid chart content.
- **No code fences** - raw Mermaid chart output only.
- **Color accuracy** - exact hex values as specified.
- **Color style** - The color of the element has to be correct.

## Example

```mermaid
---
config:
  layout: elk
---
flowchart LR
subgraph s3["Flow name"]
    n1["Element name [random id]"]
    n2["Element name [random id]"]
    { Other nodes }

  end
    n1 --> n2
    { Other edges }

    n1:::read_models
    n2:::actor

    classDef read_models fill:#b0deb3, stroke:#000, stroke-width:1px, color:#000
    classDef actor fill:#fee750, stroke:#000, stroke-width:1px, color:#000, border-radius:0
    classDef command fill:#a7c5fc,stroke:#000,stroke-width:1px,color:#000
    classDef policy fill:#da99e6, stroke:#000, stroke-width:1px, color:#000

## Event Storming to Draw\.io XML Generator

### Role

You are a specialized AI that converts event storming YAML input into valid Draw\.io XML format.

### Core Requirements

#### Element Colors (Hex Values)

| Element          | Color                  |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| actor            | `#fee750`              |
| event            | `#feae57`              |
| command          | `#a7c5fc`              |
| policy           | `#da99e6` or `#fef5b2` |
| external\_system | `#ffb3c5`              |
| read\_models     | `#b0deb3`              |

#### Generation Process & Rules

1. Scan the YAML and remember all the elements and flows.
2. Generate swimlane container with `meta.name`
3. Read the `flows` list, extract, and create all elements with appropriate colors and styles.

* Always use square note shape (even `actor`).

* Display the element `name`.

* If you see a reference with a suffix (`A.User.1`, `A.User.2`), that means it’s a reference instance. Create elements with the same `name` and `color`.

  * Example:

  ```yaml
  actors:
    - id: A.User
      name: "User"

  flows:
    - from: A.User.1
      to: C.RegisterUser
    - from: A.User.2
      to: C.LoginUser
  ```

  * In this case will have **2 elements** with name `User` and color `#fee750`.

* **Important:** If the `policy` element is before the `event` element, OR the `policy` element is after the `command` element.

  * Example:

  ```yaml
  flows:
    - from: P.Policy1
      to: E.Event1
    - from: C.Command1
      to: P.Policy2
  ```

  * In this case, the element `fill color` must be `#fef5b2`, width `240px`, height `180px`.

* `vertical_boundary` in an `event` is the line the goes through the element (under the element). Example:

  ```yaml
  events:
    - id: E.Event1
      name: "Event 1"
      vertical_boundary: true
  ```

4. Read the `flows` list, generate connection lines, and link the `source_id` to the `target_id` in a connection line.
5. Ensure all XML tags are properly closed

#### Example Input

```yaml
commands:
  - id: C.LoginUser
    name: "Login User"

policies:
  - id: P.SessionPolicy
    name: "Session Management Policy"
  - id: P.OnSuccessNavigate
    name: "On Success"
  - id: P.OnFailureShowError
    name: "On Failure"

events:
  - id: E.LoginAttempted
    name: "Login Attempted"

flows:
  - from: C.LoginUser
    to: P.SessionPolicy
  - from: P.SessionPolicy
    to: E.LoginAttempted
  - from: P.ProfileEditPolicy
    to: E.EditModeActivated
```

#### XML Structure Template

```xml
<mxGraphModel>
  <root>
    <mxCell id="0" />
    <mxCell id="1" parent="0" />
    <!-- Swimlane container -->
    <mxCell id="2" value="{context_name}" style="swimlane;startSize=30;horizontal=1;" vertex="1" parent="1">
      <mxGeometry x="0" y="0" width="2000" height="800" as="geometry" />
    </mxCell>
    <!-- Elements and connections -->
  </root>
</mxGraphModel>
```

**Element pattern**

```xml
<mxCell id="{reference_id or id}" value="{name}"
  style="shape=note;whiteSpace=wrap;html=1;backgroundOutline=1;darkOpacity=0.05;fillColor={color};strokeColor=none;fontSize=16;fontStyle=0;rotation=0;shadow=1;"
  vertex="1" parent="2">
  <mxGeometry x="{x}" y="{y}" width="120" height="120" as="geometry" />
</mxCell>
```

**Connection style pattern**

```xml
<mxCell id="{id}" style="edgeStyle=orthogonalEdgeStyle;rounded=0;orthogonalLoop=1;jettySize=auto;html=1;"
  edge="1" parent="2" source="{source_id}" target="{target_id}">
  <mxGeometry relative="1" as="geometry" />
</mxCell>
```

**Vertical boundary pattern**

```xml
<mxCell id="2" value="" style="rounded=0;whiteSpace=wrap;html=1;strokeColor=none;fillColor=#eae847;rotation=90;" vertex="1" parent="1">
  <mxGeometry x="{x}" y="{y}" width="{>=300}" height="10" as="geometry" />
</mxCell>
```

#### Output Format

* Generate **only** valid Draw\.io XML - no explanations, markdown, or code blocks
* Ensure all XML tags are properly closed and nested
* Use Draw\.io's mxGraphModel schema structure

### Critical Constraints

* **No explanatory text** - return only XML content
* **No code fences** - raw XML output only
* **Complete structure** - all elements must be properly nested
* **Proper geometry** - realistic x,y coordinates and dimensions
* **Valid IDs** - sequential numeric IDs without conflicts
* **Color accuracy** - exact hex values as specified
* **Color style** - The color of the element has to be correct

### Error Prevention

* Validate all XML tags are closed
* Check parent-child relationships are correct
* Ensure geometry coordinates don't overlap
* Verify all referenced IDs exist
* Confirm color codes match the specification exactly

## **Implement LiveKit for Real-Time Communication**

### **Overview: Purpose and Problem Solving**

* Our project requires stable realTimeVideo and realTimeAudio features to support collaboration between users.
* Building a custom webrtcServer is complex and time-consuming, while LiveKit provides tested sdkTools and serverInfra ready to use.

### **Proposal**

* Use LiveKit as the communication platform for videoCall, audioCall, and screenShare.
* Connect frontend with `livekitClient` and backend with token generation endpoint `getAccessToken`.

### **Weighting / Pros and Cons**

#### **Pros**

* LiveKit is scalable and supports adaptiveStream and dynacast, which reduce bandwidth usage.
* Provides React components like `GridLayout`, `ParticipantTile`, and `ControlBar` to build UI faster.
* Security is built-in using signed accessToken with roomName and participantIdentity.
* Reduces development time compared to building and maintaining our own signaling system.

#### **Cons**

* Adds dependency on a third-party service which increases monthly cost.
* The team needs time to learn LiveKit sdk and understand realTime media flows.
* Internet connection quality of users can affect performance, which we must handle in UI/UX.

### **Implementation Steps**

#### **1. Setup backend token service**

```ts
import "dotenv/config";
import { createContext } from "./lib/context";
import { appRouter } from "./routers/index";
import cors from "cors";
import express from "express";
import { RoomServiceClient, AccessToken } from "livekit-server-sdk";

import "dotenv/config";

const app = express();

app.use(
  cors({
    origin: process.env.CORS_ORIGIN || "",
    methods: ["GET", "POST", "OPTIONS"],
  })
);

app.use(express.json());

app.get("/", (_req, res) => {
  res.status(200).send("OK");
});

app.get("/get-token", async (req, res) => {
  const roomName = "quickstart-room";
  const participantName = String(Date.now());

  const at = new AccessToken(
    process.env.LIVEKIT_API_KEY,
    process.env.LIVEKIT_API_SECRET,
    {
      identity: participantName,
      ttl: "10m",
    }
  );
  at.addGrant({
    roomJoin: true,
    room: roomName,
  });

  const token = await at.toJwt();
  res.send(token);
});

const svc = new RoomServiceClient(
  process.env.LIVEKIT_HOST as string,
  process.env.LIVEKIT_API_KEY,
  process.env.LIVEKIT_API_SECRET
);

app.get("/rooms", async (req, res) => {
  const rooms = await svc.listRooms();
  res.json({ rooms });
});

app.get("/rooms/create", async (req, res) => {
  const opts = {
    name: "first room",
    emptyTimeout: 10 * 60,
    maxParticipants: 20,
  };

  const room = await svc.createRoom(opts);
  console.log("room created", room);

  res.json({ room });
});

const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);
});

```

#### **2. Connect frontend to LiveKit**

```tsx
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { useQuery } from "@tanstack/react-query";
import { useEffect, useRef, useState } from "react";
import {
  ControlBar,
  GridLayout,
  ParticipantTile,
  RoomAudioRenderer,
  useTracks,
  RoomContext,
} from "@livekit/components-react";
import { Room, RoomEvent, Track } from "livekit-client";
import "@livekit/components-styles";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/")({
  component: HomeComponent,
});

function HomeComponent() {
  const [room] = useState(
    () =>
      new Room({
        adaptiveStream: true,
        dynacast: true,
      }),
  );

  useEffect(() => {
    let mounted = true;

    const connect = async () => {
      const token = await fetch("http://localhost:3000/get-token").then((r) =>
        r.text(),
      );

      if (mounted) {
        await room.connect('wss://quochuydev-i4asls1o.livekit.cloud', token);
      }
    };

    connect();

    room.on("participantConnected", (p) => {
      console.log("Participant joined:", p.identity);
    });

    room.on("trackSubscribed", (track, pub, participant) => {
      console.log("Subscribed to:", track.kind, "from", participant.identity);
    });

    room.on(RoomEvent.Disconnected, () => {
      console.log("Left room");
    });

    return () => {
      mounted = false;
      room.disconnect();
    };
  }, [room]);

  return (
    <RoomContext.Provider value={room}>
      <div data-lk-theme="default" style={{ height: "100vh" }}>
        <MyVideoConference />
        <RoomAudioRenderer />
        <ControlBar />
      </div>
    </RoomContext.Provider>
  );
}

function MyVideoConference() {
  const tracks = useTracks(
    [
      {
        source: Track.Source.Camera,
        withPlaceholder: true,
      },
      {
        source: Track.Source.ScreenShare,
        withPlaceholder: false,
      },
    ],
    {
      onlySubscribed: false,
    },
  );

  return (
    <GridLayout
      tracks={tracks}
      style={{ height: "calc(100vh - var(--lk-control-bar-height))" }}
    >
      <ParticipantTile />
    </GridLayout>
  );
}

```

### **Conclusion**

* LiveKit gives us a proven platform to handle video, audio, and data communication without building complex webrtc logic ourselves.
* It saves time, improves scalability, and allows the team to focus on core product features.
* I recommend moving forward with LiveKit integration to achieve reliable real-time collaboration.


## Multi-OIDC Session Management  Application

Managing multiple OpenID Connect (OIDC) sessions across different applications can be complex. Inspired by the NextAuth framework, this open-source project provides a robust solution for handling multi-OIDC sessions efficiently.

[https://github.com/quochuydev/next-multiple-oidc-sessions](https://github.com/quochuydev/next-multiple-oidc-sessions)

This blog walks you through the benefits, implementation steps, and references for getting started with this powerful authentication framework.

### Outcome and Benefit

#### Centralized Session Management

The primary outcome of this project is a centralized authentication system that efficiently manages multiple OIDC sessions across different applications. By centralizing session management, you gain:

* **Consistent User Experience**: Users can seamlessly switch between multiple applications (`app.example.local/app1`, `app.example.local/app2`) without needing to re-authenticate.
* **Simplified Integration**: With a shared authentication service (`auth.example.local`), integrating new applications into your ecosystem becomes much easier and less error-prone.

### Implementation Steps

#### 1. Set Up the Repository

Clone the GitHub repository and explore the three core applications:

* **`app.example.local/app1`**
* **`app.example.local/app2`**
* **`auth.example.local`**

Each of these applications is designed to work together to provide a seamless authentication experience across different domains.

#### 2. Configure the Auth Service (`auth.example.local`)

The `auth.example.local` application acts as the central authentication hub. Here’s how to set it up:

* **OIDC Configuration**: Configure your OIDC providers (like Google, Facebook, etc.) within the `auth.example.local` application. This includes setting up client IDs, secrets, and redirect URIs.
* **Session Management**: Implement session handling logic that supports multiple active sessions per user, allowing seamless switching between applications.

#### 3. Integrate with Application 1 (`app.example.local/app1`)

* **OIDC Client Setup**: In `app.example.local/app1`, set up the OIDC client to interact with the `auth.example.local` service.
* **Session Handling**: Ensure that `app.example.local/app1` correctly handles session tokens received from the authentication service. Store and manage these tokens securely.

#### 4. Integrate with Application 2 (`app.example.local/app2`)

* **Repeat the Process**: Just like in `app.example.local/app1`, set up the OIDC client in `app.example.local/app2`. Ensure seamless session management between `app.example.local/app2` and the central `auth.example.local`.

#### 5. Test Across Applications

* **Cross-Application Testing**: Test user logins and session management across `app.example.local/app1` and `app.example.local/app2`. Ensure that sessions persist and that users can switch between applications without re-authentication.
* **Security Audits**: Conduct thorough security testing to ensure that session tokens are handled securely and that no vulnerabilities exist in cross-application session management.

## **Implement LLM-Powered Neo4j Entity Management**

### **Overview: Purpose and Problem Solving**

* This MVP demonstrates managing entities, fields, and relationships in a Neo4j graph database using a GPT-4 agent.
* It eliminates manual Cypher queries and allows users to describe database operations in natural language.

### **Proposal**

* Use GPT-4 via `FunctionAgent` from `llama_index` to interpret instructions and execute Neo4j operations.
* Integrate `Neo4jPropertyGraphStore` to store and retrieve entities, fields, and relationships programmatically.

### **Weighting / Pros and Cons**

#### **Pros**

* Rapid prototyping of database structure without writing Cypher manually.
* Easy extension to new projects, entities, or relationships through simple instructions.
* Structured JSON output enables integration with other systems.

#### **Cons**

* Hardcoded credentials and minimal error handling reduce production readiness.
* Performance may decrease with many entities or fields due to individual `MERGE` operations.
* Agent instructions require careful formatting to avoid misinterpretation.

### **Implementation Steps**

#### **1. Setup Environment**

* Install required packages: `neo4j`, `llama_index`, `openai`, `pydantic`, `dotenv`.
* Configure `.env` for API keys and Neo4j credentials.

#### **2. Connect to Neo4j**

* Use `checkNeo4jConnection()` to verify connectivity and raise error if unavailable.
* Initialize `Neo4jPropertyGraphStore` for structured queries.

#### **3. Define Data Models**

* Create `EntityDetails`, `CreateEntityResponse`, and `CreateRelationResponse` with Pydantic for validation.
* These models ensure consistent and strict JSON responses.

#### **4. Implement CRUD Functions**

* `createEntity(project, entity, fields)` creates project, entity, and fields in Neo4j.
* `createRelation(source, target, relation)` adds relationships between entities.
* `getEntityDetails(entity)` retrieves entity, fields, and related entities in JSON format.

#### **5. Wrap Functions as Tools**

* Use `FunctionTool.from_defaults()` to expose each CRUD function to the agent.
* Prepare `FunctionAgent` with `tools=[createEntityTool, createRelationTool, getEntityTool]` for LLM-driven execution.

#### **6. Run Agent for Demo**

* Execute `agent.run()` with natural language instructions to create entities and relationships.
* Query entity details to verify successful insertion and relations.

### **Conclusion**

* This MVP shows GPT-4 as an intelligent interface for Neo4j, simplifying entity management.
* The system can be expanded for multiple projects, dynamic instructions, and automated knowledge graph construction.

## Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) Management

Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is one of the most critical project management tools that helps break down complex projects into manageable, smaller components. This guide will walk you through the fundamentals of WBS management, including practical examples and best practices for effective project planning.

### What is Work Breakdown Structure?

A Work Breakdown Structure is a hierarchical decomposition of the total scope of work to be carried out by the project team. It organizes and defines the total scope of the project, where each descending level represents an increasingly detailed definition of the project work.

#### Key Benefits of WBS:

* **Clear Project Scope**: Provides a visual representation of all project deliverables
* **Better Estimation**: Enables more accurate time and cost estimates
* **Resource Planning**: Helps identify required resources for each work package
* **Risk Management**: Makes it easier to identify potential risks at granular levels
* **Progress Tracking**: Facilitates monitoring and controlling project progress
* **Team Communication**: Improves understanding among stakeholders

### WBS Structure and Components

#### The 100% Rule

The WBS must include 100% of the work defined by the project scope and capture all deliverables – internal, external, and interim – in terms of the work to be completed, including project management.

### WBS Management Sheet

A well-structured WBS sheet should include the following elements:

![WBS Management Sheet](/wbs-management/wbs-sheet.png)

The WBS sheet above demonstrates a practical approach to organizing project work with:

* **Category**:
* **Feature ID**:
* **Feature**:
* **Task ID**:
* **Task**:
* **Subtask ID**:
* **Subtask**:
* **Description**:
* **Effort Estimation (Hours)**:
* **Assignee**:
* **Start Date**:
* **End Date**:
* **Status**: Backlog, Ready, In Progress, Testing, Done, Closed
* **Priority**: Critical, High, Medium, Low
* **Notes**:

### Best Practices for WBS Management

* Keep It Simple and Clear
* Focus on Deliverables
* Maintain Appropriate Level of Detail
* Ensure Completeness
* Regular Updates and Reviews

### Measuring WBS Effectiveness

#### Key Performance Indicators:

1. **Scope Completeness**: Percentage of actual work covered by WBS
2. **Estimation Accuracy**: Variance between planned and actual effort
3. **Change Request Frequency**: Number of scope changes required
4. **Stakeholder Understanding**: Survey results on WBS clarity
5. **Project Success Rate**: Correlation with project success metrics

### Conclusion

Work Breakdown Structure is a fundamental project management technique that provides the foundation for successful project planning and execution. When properly implemented, WBS enhances project visibility, improves estimation accuracy, and facilitates better communication among stakeholders.

Key takeaways:

* **Structure matters**: A well-organized WBS is crucial for project success
* **Balance detail levels**: Neither too granular nor too high-level
* **Focus on deliverables**: What will be produced, not how it will be done
* **Maintain and update**: WBS is a living document that evolves with the project
* **Integrate with other tools**: Combine with estimation, scheduling, and risk management
