## Multi-OIDC Session Management  Application

Managing multiple OpenID Connect (OIDC) sessions across different applications can be complex. Inspired by the NextAuth framework, this open-source project provides a robust solution for handling multi-OIDC sessions efficiently.

[https://github.com/quochuydev/next-multiple-oidc-sessions](https://github.com/quochuydev/next-multiple-oidc-sessions)

This blog walks you through the benefits, implementation steps, and references for getting started with this powerful authentication framework.

### Outcome and Benefit

#### Centralized Session Management

The primary outcome of this project is a centralized authentication system that efficiently manages multiple OIDC sessions across different applications. By centralizing session management, you gain:

* **Consistent User Experience**: Users can seamlessly switch between multiple applications (`app.example.local/app1`, `app.example.local/app2`) without needing to re-authenticate.
* **Simplified Integration**: With a shared authentication service (`auth.example.local`), integrating new applications into your ecosystem becomes much easier and less error-prone.

### Implementation Steps

#### 1. Set Up the Repository

Clone the GitHub repository and explore the three core applications:

* **`app.example.local/app1`**
* **`app.example.local/app2`**
* **`auth.example.local`**

Each of these applications is designed to work together to provide a seamless authentication experience across different domains.

#### 2. Configure the Auth Service (`auth.example.local`)

The `auth.example.local` application acts as the central authentication hub. Here’s how to set it up:

* **OIDC Configuration**: Configure your OIDC providers (like Google, Facebook, etc.) within the `auth.example.local` application. This includes setting up client IDs, secrets, and redirect URIs.
* **Session Management**: Implement session handling logic that supports multiple active sessions per user, allowing seamless switching between applications.

#### 3. Integrate with Application 1 (`app.example.local/app1`)

* **OIDC Client Setup**: In `app.example.local/app1`, set up the OIDC client to interact with the `auth.example.local` service.
* **Session Handling**: Ensure that `app.example.local/app1` correctly handles session tokens received from the authentication service. Store and manage these tokens securely.

#### 4. Integrate with Application 2 (`app.example.local/app2`)

* **Repeat the Process**: Just like in `app.example.local/app1`, set up the OIDC client in `app.example.local/app2`. Ensure seamless session management between `app.example.local/app2` and the central `auth.example.local`.

#### 5. Test Across Applications

* **Cross-Application Testing**: Test user logins and session management across `app.example.local/app1` and `app.example.local/app2`. Ensure that sessions persist and that users can switch between applications without re-authentication.
* **Security Audits**: Conduct thorough security testing to ensure that session tokens are handled securely and that no vulnerabilities exist in cross-application session management.

## Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) Management

Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is one of the most critical project management tools that helps break down complex projects into manageable, smaller components. This guide will walk you through the fundamentals of WBS management, including practical examples and best practices for effective project planning.

### What is Work Breakdown Structure?

A Work Breakdown Structure is a hierarchical decomposition of the total scope of work to be carried out by the project team. It organizes and defines the total scope of the project, where each descending level represents an increasingly detailed definition of the project work.

#### Key Benefits of WBS:

* **Clear Project Scope**: Provides a visual representation of all project deliverables
* **Better Estimation**: Enables more accurate time and cost estimates
* **Resource Planning**: Helps identify required resources for each work package
* **Risk Management**: Makes it easier to identify potential risks at granular levels
* **Progress Tracking**: Facilitates monitoring and controlling project progress
* **Team Communication**: Improves understanding among stakeholders

### WBS Structure and Components

#### The 100% Rule

The WBS must include 100% of the work defined by the project scope and capture all deliverables – internal, external, and interim – in terms of the work to be completed, including project management.

#### Hierarchical Levels

1. **Level 1**: Project Title/Final Deliverable
2. **Level 2**: Major Deliverables or Phases
3. **Level 3**: Sub-deliverables
4. **Level 4+**: Work Packages (lowest level)

### WBS Creation Process

#### Step 1: Define Project Scope

Start with a clear understanding of project objectives, deliverables, and constraints.

#### Step 2: Identify Major Deliverables

Break down the project into major components or phases.

#### Step 3: Decompose Deliverables

Continue breaking down each major deliverable into smaller, manageable components.

#### Step 4: Create Work Packages

Define the lowest level of work that can be:

* Estimated (time and cost)
* Scheduled
* Monitored
* Assigned to a responsible party

### WBS Management Sheet

A well-structured WBS sheet should include the following elements:

![WBS Management Sheet](/wbs-management/wbs-sheet.png)

The WBS sheet above demonstrates a practical approach to organizing project work with:

* **WBS ID**: Unique identifier for each work package
* **Task Description**: Clear description of the work to be performed
* **Deliverables**: Expected outcomes for each task
* **Dependencies**: Relationships between tasks
* **Assigned Resources**: Team members responsible for each work package
* **Priority Level**: Task priority for resource allocation

#### Key Components of the WBS Sheet:

1. **Hierarchical Numbering**: Each element has a unique WBS code (1.1, 1.2, 1.1.1, etc.)
2. **Task Names**: Descriptive names for each work component
3. **Work Package Details**: Specific activities that need to be completed
4. **Responsibility Assignment**: Clear ownership for each task
5. **Deliverable Specifications**: Expected outputs and quality criteria

### Estimation and Time Management

Accurate estimation is crucial for successful project delivery. The estimation process should be integrated with your WBS structure.

![Estimation Sheet](/wbs-management/est-sheet.png)

The estimation sheet complements the WBS by providing:

* **Time Estimates**: Duration for each work package
* **Resource Requirements**: Human resources needed
* **Cost Calculations**: Budget allocation for each component
* **Risk Factors**: Contingency planning for uncertainties
* **Dependencies Mapping**: Critical path identification

#### Estimation Techniques:

1. **Expert Judgment**: Leveraging experience from similar projects
2. **Analogous Estimation**: Using historical data from comparable projects
3. **Parametric Estimation**: Using statistical relationships between variables
4. **Three-Point Estimation**: Considering optimistic, pessimistic, and most likely scenarios
5. **Bottom-Up Estimation**: Aggregating estimates from work package level

### Best Practices for WBS Management

#### 1. Keep It Simple and Clear

* Use clear, concise language
* Avoid technical jargon when possible
* Ensure understanding across all stakeholders

#### 2. Focus on Deliverables

* Structure around deliverables, not activities
* Each element should represent a tangible outcome
* Avoid mixing deliverables with activities

#### 3. Maintain Appropriate Level of Detail

* Don't over-decompose (too granular)
* Don't under-decompose (too high-level)
* Aim for work packages of 8-80 hours duration

#### 4. Ensure Completeness

* Include all project work
* Account for project management activities
* Consider integration and testing phases

#### 5. Regular Updates and Reviews

* Review WBS regularly as project evolves
* Update based on change requests
* Maintain version control

### WBS Templates and Tools

#### Common WBS Formats:

1. **Hierarchical/Tree Structure**: Traditional org-chart style
2. **Tabular Format**: Spreadsheet-based approach
3. **Mind Map**: Visual, creative representation

#### Recommended Tools:

* **Microsoft Project**: Professional project management
* **Excel/Google Sheets**: Simple, accessible option
* **Lucidchart**: Visual diagramming
* **Smartsheet**: Collaborative project management
* **Notion**: All-in-one workspace
* **Jira**: Agile project management

### Integration with Project Management Methodologies

#### Traditional/Waterfall Projects

* WBS aligns with sequential phases
* Clear deliverables at each stage
* Detailed upfront planning

#### Agile Projects

* Epic/Feature breakdown structure
* User story decomposition
* Sprint planning integration
* Continuous refinement

#### Hybrid Approaches

* Combination of detailed planning and iterative delivery
* Phased WBS development
* Adaptive planning techniques

### Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

#### 1. Over-Decomposition

**Problem**: Breaking down work into unnecessarily small pieces
**Solution**: Use the 8-80 hour rule for work packages

#### 2. Activity-Based WBS

**Problem**: Focusing on activities instead of deliverables
**Solution**: Structure around "what" will be delivered, not "how"

#### 3. Incomplete Scope Coverage

**Problem**: Missing work components
**Solution**: Use structured review process and stakeholder validation

#### 4. Poor Naming Conventions

**Problem**: Unclear or inconsistent naming
**Solution**: Establish and follow naming standards

#### 5. Static WBS

**Problem**: Not updating WBS as project evolves
**Solution**: Regular reviews and version control

### Measuring WBS Effectiveness

#### Key Performance Indicators:

1. **Scope Completeness**: Percentage of actual work covered by WBS
2. **Estimation Accuracy**: Variance between planned and actual effort
3. **Change Request Frequency**: Number of scope changes required
4. **Stakeholder Understanding**: Survey results on WBS clarity
5. **Project Success Rate**: Correlation with project success metrics

### Advanced WBS Techniques

#### 1. Rolling Wave Planning

* Detailed planning for near-term work
* High-level planning for future phases
* Progressive elaboration as more information becomes available

#### 2. WBS Dictionary

* Detailed descriptions for each WBS element
* Acceptance criteria and quality standards
* Resource requirements and assumptions

#### 3. Integrated Change Control

* Formal process for WBS updates
* Impact assessment procedures
* Stakeholder approval workflows
