**Reasoning:** Bitcoin is currently consolidating in the $90K-$95K range after reaching ATH of $126K in late 2025. Q1 2026 is expected to be a consolidation phase as markets digest late-2025 volatility. Institutional buying remains strong with $471M ETF inflows on the first trading day of 2026. The second half of 2026 should see more constructive price action as Fed policy potentially becomes more dovish after Powell's departure in May, with analyst consensus ranging from $120K-$170K by year-end. The 2028 halving anticipation should support prices throughout 2026-2027.
