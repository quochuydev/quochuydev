# Daily Notes - December 29, 2025

## BTC Price Prediction (1 month)

**Current Price:** $90,000 (December 29, 2025)
**Target Date:** January 29, 2026

**Prediction: $98,500** (+9.4%)

**Reasoning:** Bitcoin is currently in "Extreme Fear" territory (index at 24), trading ~30% below its October ATH of $126,000. Historically, extreme fear readings combined with post-halving supply dynamics create favorable entry points. The recent $825M ETF outflows are primarily tax-loss harvesting, not fundamental weakness—IBIT still attracted $25.4B in net inflows in 2025. Corporate treasuries (DATs) added 42k BTC in December, their largest accumulation since July. With the holiday liquidity crunch ending and institutional desks returning in January, the $91,000 resistance level should break, targeting the $98,000-$100,000 zone where technical analysis shows confluence.
