# The Problem: Why Agile?

Traditional waterfall development faced critical challenges:

<v-click>

## 📅 Late Feedback
- Requirements gathered upfront
- Development takes months
- Testing happens at the end
- **Customer sees product only at launch**

</v-click>

::right::

<v-click>

## 🔒 Rigid Requirements
- Changes are expensive
- "Scope creep" is feared
- Market evolves, but product can't

</v-click>

<v-click>

## 💥 Big-Bang Releases
- High risk deployments
- All-or-nothing approach
- Difficult to troubleshoot issues

</v-click>

# What is Agile?

<v-click>

## Born in 2001
17 software developers met in Snowbird, Utah and created the **Agile Manifesto**

</v-click>

<v-click>

## Definition
> An **iterative, collaborative, and adaptive** approach to software development that emphasizes:
> - Frequent delivery of working software
> - Close collaboration with customers
> - Flexibility to respond to change
> - Empowered, self-organizing teams

</v-click>

<v-click>

## The Goal
**Deliver value to customers faster and more reliably**

</v-click>

# The 4 Core Values

The Agile Manifesto's foundation:

<v-click>

## 1. 👥 Individuals and interactions
**over** processes and tools

<div class="text-sm opacity-75">Great teams with mediocre tools > mediocre teams with great tools</div>

</v-click>

<v-click>

## 2. 💻 Working software
**over** comprehensive documentation

<div class="text-sm opacity-75">Focus on delivering value, not creating artifacts</div>

</v-click>

<v-click>

## 3. 🤝 Customer collaboration
**over** contract negotiation

<div class="text-sm opacity-75">Partner with customers, don't just fulfill contracts</div>

</v-click>

<v-click>

## 4. 🔄 Responding to change
**over** following a plan

<div class="text-sm opacity-75">Embrace change as a competitive advantage</div>

</v-click>

# Key Principles (Simplified)

The 12 principles distilled into beginner-friendly concepts:

<v-click>

## 🎯 Customer Satisfaction
**Our highest priority** is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software

</v-click>

<v-click>

## 🔓 Welcome Changing Requirements
Even late in development. Agile harnesses change for the customer's competitive advantage

</v-click>

<v-click>

## 📦 Deliver Frequently
Working software delivered in **short timescales** (weeks, not months)

</v-click>

<v-click>

## 🤝 Daily Collaboration
Business people and developers must work together **daily** throughout the project

</v-click>

# How Agile Works in Practice

<v-click>

## Iterations (Sprints)
Short cycles of **1-4 weeks**:
1. Plan what to build
2. Build it
3. Test it
4. Demo to stakeholders
5. Get feedback
6. Repeat!

</v-click>

<v-click>

## Regular Ceremonies
- **Daily standup** (15 min sync)
- **Sprint planning** (plan the work)
- **Sprint review** (demo results)
- **Retrospective** (improve process)

</v-click>

::right::

<v-click>

## Incremental Delivery

Instead of building everything at once:

```
❌ Waterfall:
[4 wheels] → [chassis] → [body] → [engine] → 🚗
(Nothing usable until the end)

✅ Agile:
🚲 (usable!) → 🛵 (better!) → 🚗 (complete!)
(Each iteration delivers value)
```

</v-click>

<v-click>

**Feedback at every step** means you build the right thing!

</v-click>

# Common Agile Frameworks

<v-click>

## 🏉 Scrum
**Most popular framework** (about 66% of Agile teams)

- **Roles:** Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team
- **Artifacts:** Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Increment
- **Events:** Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, Retrospective
- **Best for:** Teams building complex products with evolving requirements

</v-click>

<v-click>

## 📊 Kanban
**Visual workflow management**

- Focus on continuous flow (no sprints)
- Visualize work on a board: To Do → In Progress → Done
- Limit work in progress (WIP)
- **Best for:** Support teams, maintenance work, continuous delivery

</v-click>

<v-click>

## 🎯 Which to Choose?
- **Scrum:** Need structure, clear milestones, regular cadence
- **Kanban:** Need flexibility, variable workload, continuous flow
- **Scrumban:** Hybrid approach combining both

</v-click>

# Getting Started with Agile

<v-click>

## 🚀 Start Small
- **Don't transform everything at once**
- Pick one team, one project
- Learn from experience, then scale

</v-click>

<v-click>

## 🎯 Key Practices to Adopt First
1. **Short iterations** - Start with 2-week sprints
2. **Daily standups** - 15-minute team sync
3. **Demos** - Show working software to stakeholders
4. **Retrospectives** - Continuously improve

</v-click>

<v-click>

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Agile in name only** - Following rituals without embracing values
- **No customer involvement** - Agile requires active customer participation
- **Skipping retrospectives** - You won't improve without reflection
- **Too much documentation** - Focus on working software
