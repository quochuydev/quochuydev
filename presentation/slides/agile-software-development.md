# The Problem

## Traditional "Waterfall" Approach

<v-clicks>

- Requirements gathered all at once, upfront
- Long development cycles (months or years)
- Customer sees product only at the end
- Changes are expensive and difficult
- High risk of building the wrong thing

</v-clicks>

---

# What is Agile?

<v-clicks>

- An **iterative approach** to software development
- Work in short cycles called **sprints** (1-4 weeks)
- Deliver working software **frequently**
- **Adapt** to changes quickly
- **Collaborate** closely with customers

</v-clicks>

<v-click>

```
Traditional:  Requirements → Design → Build → Test → Deploy (months)

Agile:        [Sprint 1] → [Sprint 2] → [Sprint 3] → ... (weeks)
                  ↓            ↓            ↓
              Working      Working      Working
              Software     Software     Software
```

# The 4 Core Values

## The Agile Manifesto (2001)

<v-clicks>

- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
- **Responding to change** over following a plan

</v-clicks>

<v-click>

> "While there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more."

</v-click>

# Key Principles

<v-clicks>

- **Deliver early and often** - Satisfy customer with continuous delivery
- **Welcome change** - Even late in development
- **Work together daily** - Business and developers collaborate
- **Trust your team** - Build around motivated people
- **Keep it simple** - Maximize work NOT done
- **Reflect and improve** - Regular team retrospectives

</v-clicks>

# Popular Frameworks

<v-clicks>

| Framework | Best For | Key Feature |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **Scrum** | Most teams | Structured sprints with defined roles |
| **Kanban** | Continuous flow | Visual board, WIP limits |
| **XP** | High-quality code | Pair programming, TDD |

</v-clicks>

<v-click>

Most teams start with **Scrum** - it provides clear structure for beginners

</v-click>

# Scrum Basics

## Three Roles

<v-clicks>

- **Product Owner** - Defines what to build, prioritizes work
- **Scrum Master** - Facilitates process, removes blockers
- **Development Team** - Builds the product (3-9 people)

</v-clicks>

---

# Scrum Basics

## Four Ceremonies

<v-clicks>

- **Sprint Planning** - Team selects work for the sprint
- **Daily Standup** - 15-min sync: What did I do? What will I do? Any blockers?
- **Sprint Review** - Demo completed work to stakeholders
- **Retrospective** - What went well? What to improve?

</v-clicks>

---

# Getting Started

## How to adopt Agile

<v-clicks>

- Start small - Pick one team or project
- Choose a framework - Scrum is great for beginners
- Get training - Invest in learning
- Use a board - Physical or digital (Jira, Trello)
- Focus on people - Tools don't make you Agile
- Inspect and adapt - Improve every sprint
