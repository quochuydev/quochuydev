**Upwork**

Integrate AI (LLM) into Next.js + Node.js Application

Summary
I need a developer who can integrate an AI or LLM model into an existing Next.js + Node.js web application. The goal is to add smart, context-aware functionality that enhances user interaction and automates some backend logic.

You should be comfortable working with APIs like OpenAI, Anthropic, or similar providers, and know how to handle authentication, response parsing, and front-end integration.

The codebase is already set up and clean — your main task will be connecting the AI layer, testing responses, and making sure everything runs smoothly in both development and production environments.

If you’ve done similar work before, please share a brief example or describe your approach. Quick and efficient delivery will be appreciated.

Hi,

I've integrated LLMs into multiple Next.js + Node.js applications using OpenAI and Anthropic APIs. I can add smart AI features to your app quickly and cleanly.

Here are practical AI features I can implement:

Option 1: Smart Text Helper
AI-powered content generation (descriptions, summaries, suggestions) via single API endpoint. Uses Anthropic Claude API with proper error handling. Example: Generate product descriptions, email drafts, or summaries.

Option 2: Intelligent Form Assistant
AI validates and enriches user input, auto-completes or suggests corrections. Example: Address validation, categorization, or data extraction.

Option 3: Context-Aware Chatbot
Simple chat interface with streaming responses. Can answer FAQs based on your app context and integrates with your existing data.

My focus will be on: Proper prompt engineering and context management, streaming responses for smooth UX, token usage optimization to control costs, handling AI failures gracefully with fallbacks, and secure API key management.

I can start immediately and deliver. Happy to discuss which AI feature would be most valuable for your use case first.

Looking forward to working with you!
```
