Skilled Integration - Prepare and Merge Interfaces React Node NextJS

Summary
The chat app is main interface (codecanyon A)
The shop app is secondary interface (codecanyon B)

Within the chat app, the user can browse each other's profiles already.

In the profiles, we want to link to the user's shop. (B) This will need a optional screen where the user will say 'yes I want to build my shop', then the user must fill some onboarding details.

Other users will now see a shop symbol under the profile name which will mean the user has a shop.

Once inside the user's shop (B) , users can see reviews, things for sale, and use existing shopping features to buy, sell and checkout. The user needs new symbol next to the shop name right side, to go back to the chat profile. (A)

Existing chat feature in the shopping website (B) must be deprecated

Sign up for the shopping website (B) must be deprecated

We also need to add shopping access button via chat app (A) if the user wishes to search for products, buy, sell, track orders and more and a go back to button to return to chat app (A). We can use the bottom nav tab to add these.

The display resolution, fonts, tones and designs of search bars, tabs, buttons, forms, prompts and pages must be unified.

Followup project after this will be:
