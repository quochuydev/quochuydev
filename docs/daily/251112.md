**Me**

This is the first blog. I am targeting to write everyday, to share my knowledge about technical, tip, work and personal experience.

Today I want to share about agentic AI coding, improve coding quality, consistency, versioning and easy to maintain for any other one who maintain/develop it.

This topic focusing in 4 technical stacks:

- Claude plugin: Superpower
- Consistency document, diagram, source of truth document: Mermaid
- Ticket management and workflow: Github issue and Github action.
- Deployment: Dokploy

How it works:

- Member create an issue for the feature/bug, with clear description and information.
- They mention to claude to trigger generate the plan.
- Workflow automatically create a branch and generate the coding plan.
- Member review the plan, feedback in the issue comment mentioning to the claude.
- Trigger execute plan by mention claude in the issue comment.
- The code is automatically generated, commit to the branch and then create a pull request.
- Member review the code, feedback in the PR comment.
- Mention claude in PR to deploy to preview environment.
- Everything is fine, merge to main branch.
- Mention claude in main branch to deploy to production environment (or development or staging environment, depend on the current system).

Solution step by step:

1. Setting up Claude github action and Superpower plugin in Github workflow.

```
|-- .github
|  |-- workflows
|  |  |-- claude-brainstorming.yml
|  |  |-- claude-write-plan.yml
|  |  |-- claude-execute-plan.yml
```

2. Deploy preview environment with Dokploy.

The purpose of this is to let member can quickly deploy their following ticket into server, use and test it before it is merged to main branch.

```
|-- .dokploy
|  |-- preview
|  |  |-- main.ts
```

3. Deploy production environment with Dokploy.
