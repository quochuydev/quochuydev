Job details
Property Listing Feature (React, Node, Sequelize, MySQL, Tailwind)
Full Stack Development Posted Nov 17, 2025
Overview:
Build a compact, production-quality property listing feature for a rental website: backend APIs + DB models (Sequelize/MySQL), a responsive frontend (React + Tailwind), image upload & preview, and clean integration with error handling and documentation.

Why this task:
This is a focused, end-to-end feature meant to slot into an existing project. It’s ideal for a single full-stack developer who can produce clear, modular code and hand over a ready-to-run repo with setup instructions.

Tech stack :
Backend: Node.js (Express) + Sequelize ORM + MySQL
Frontend: React (V18+) + Tailwind CSS
Storage: Local file storage (for this task) images saved to server uploads/ (S3-ready structure welcome)

Testing / Tools (nice-to-have): Postman collection or curl examples, ESLint/Prettier config

Scope & Deliverables (must deliver all)

Backend

1. Sequelize models:

Property (title, description, price, address, city, state, country, zip, bedrooms, bathrooms, sqft, amenities JSON/array, status, createdAt/updatedAt, ownerId)

PropertyImage (id, propertyId FK, filename, url, isPrimary, createdAt)

Include migrations (or Sequelize sync script) and model associations (one-to-many).

2. REST APIs:

POST /api/properties: create a new property with multiple images (multipart/form-data). Return created object with images.

GET /api/properties: list properties with pagination, search (by city/title), and basic filters (minPrice, maxPrice, bedrooms).

GET /api/properties/:id: fetch property details including images.

3. Image handling:
   Accept multiple images; validate file types and size; store under uploads/properties/propertyId/
   Return accessible URLs (relative path is fine).

4. Optimized queries:
   Use appropriate eager-loading (Sequelize include) and pagination (limit/offset) to avoid N+1. Index recommendation for searchable columns (e.g., city, price).

5. Security:
   Basic input validation (express-validator or equivalent).
   Sanitize inputs to prevent SQL injection / XSS.
   File validation and safe filename handling.

6. Docs:

README explaining DB setup, migrations, env vars, how to run server, sample requests.

Frontend

1. React components/pages:
   Create Property Form:
   Inputs: title, description, price, address fields, bedrooms, bathrooms, sqft, amenities (tags or multi-checkbox), images (multi file).
   Client-side validation (required fields, numeric ranges, image previews).
   Image preview & ability to remove before upload.
   Show upload progress and friendly error messages.

Property List / Search:
Simple paginated grid or list view, thumbnail image, title, city, price.

Property Detail Page:
Carousel or gallery of images, full details, amenities list, contact/owner placeholder.

2. Styling:
   Tailwind UI design: responsive layout, mobile-first.
   Clean, accessible forms and buttons.

3. Integration:

Connect to backend APIs, handle loading / error states, and display server validation errors.

4. Docs:

README with frontend setup, env (API base URL), how to run.

Integration & Delivery

One repo or two (backend + frontend) either is fine; include root README explaining start commands.

Include sample .env.example.

Final acceptance: run the backend and frontend locally and demonstrate create + view flow end-to-end.

What I will provide

Existing website repo URL (developer should provide simple instructions to integrate).

MySQL credentials for local dev (or instructions to create DB).
(If you prefer S3 for image storage, mention it and provide keys but local uploads are acceptable for this task.)

## Technical solution (step by step) for Cover Letter

- For developer and client understand, because almost upwork's client know technical
- Don't use Markdown format - Use text format
- Maximum 1250 characters, to copy/paste to the form

Hi, your job description is clear and easy to understand especially backend part.
For this job, I will build your property listing feature with clean, production-ready code that's easy to maintain and scale.
Some data fields are not clear to me, hope that we can work and discuss about it.

Frontend features:
- TanStack Query (React Query) - Already in your cover letter, perfect for data fetching
- React Hook Form + Zod - Form validation with TypeScript integration
- Framer Motion - Smooth transitions for grid/list view, image gallery
- React Image Gallery or React Carousel - Property detail image carousel
- React Select - Advanced dropdowns for city/state filters

File Upload & Image Handling:
- React Dropzone - Drag-and-drop image upload with preview
- Upload file to S3 with presigned URL (Reduce server RAM usage, direct upload to S3 by a secure URL generated)
