# Multi-OIDC Session Management  Application

Managing multiple OpenID Connect (OIDC) sessions across different applications can be complex. Inspired by the NextAuth framework, this open-source project provides a robust solution for handling multi-OIDC sessions efficiently. This blog walks you through the benefits, implementation steps, and references for getting started with this powerful authentication framework.

## Outcome and Benefit

### Centralized Session Management
The primary outcome of this project is a centralized authentication system that efficiently manages multiple OIDC sessions across different applications. By centralizing session management, you gain:

- **Consistent User Experience**: Users can seamlessly switch between multiple applications (`app.example.local/app1`, `app.example.local/app2`) without needing to re-authenticate.
- **Simplified Integration**: With a shared authentication service (`auth.example.local`), integrating new applications into your ecosystem becomes much easier and less error-prone.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Set Up the Repository
Clone the GitHub repository and explore the three core applications:

- **`app.example.local/app1`**
- **`app.example.local/app2`**
- **`auth.example.local`**

Each of these applications is designed to work together to provide a seamless authentication experience across different domains.

### 2. Configure the Auth Service (`auth.example.local`)
The `auth.example.local` application acts as the central authentication hub. Hereâ€™s how to set it up:

- **OIDC Configuration**: Configure your OIDC providers (like Google, Facebook, etc.) within the `auth.example.local` application. This includes setting up client IDs, secrets, and redirect URIs.
- **Session Management**: Implement session handling logic that supports multiple active sessions per user, allowing seamless switching between applications.

### 3. Integrate with Application 1 (`app.example.local/app1`)

- **OIDC Client Setup**: In `app.example.local/app1`, set up the OIDC client to interact with the `auth.example.local` service.
- **Session Handling**: Ensure that `app.example.local/app1` correctly handles session tokens received from the authentication service. Store and manage these tokens securely.

### 4. Integrate with Application 2 (`app.example.local/app2`)

- **Repeat the Process**: Just like in `app.example.local/app1`, set up the OIDC client in `app.example.local/app2`. Ensure seamless session management between `app.example.local/app2` and the central `auth.example.local`.

### 5. Test Across Applications

- **Cross-Application Testing**: Test user logins and session management across `app.example.local/app1` and `app.example.local/app2`. Ensure that sessions persist and that users can switch between applications without re-authentication.
- **Security Audits**: Conduct thorough security testing to ensure that session tokens are handled securely and that no vulnerabilities exist in cross-application session management.

### 6. Deploy and Scale

- **Deployment**: Deploy the applications in a production environment. Consider using Docker and Kubernetes for easy scaling and management.
- **Monitoring**: Implement logging and monitoring to keep track of session activity and security events.
