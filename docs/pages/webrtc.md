# Telemedicine Platform Requirements

## 1. Overview

- We aim to build a secure, scalable telemedicine platform similar in quality to certified European solutions.
- The system will allow patients and healthcare professionals to connect via video consultations, with supporting features such as chat, file sharing, and appointment management.
- Technology stack: **Node.js (backend), Vite (frontend), WebRTC (real-time communication), AWS (cloud infrastructure)**.

## 2. Core Features

### 2.1 Management

- Patient and practitioner registration/login.
- Authentication: AWS Cognito with MFA, SSO support.
- User roles: Patient, Doctor, Admin.
- Clinic information management:
  - Clinic name
  - Clinic address
  - Clinic phone
  - Clinic email
  - Clinic website
  - Clinic logo
  - Clinic description
- Patient Profile management:
  - Personal information
  - Medical history
  - Insurance information
- Doctor Profile management:
  - Personal information
  - Medical specialty
  - Availability

### 2.2 Appointment Management

- Booking and scheduling system with calendar integration.
- Virtual waiting room with notifications.
- Rescheduling and cancellation workflows.

### 2.3 Video Consultation

- **WebRTC-based video/audio calls**.
- One-on-one sessions and group calls (up to 20 participants).
- Features: screen sharing, text chat, file/document exchange.
- End-to-end encryption for all media streams.

### 2.4 Documentation & Prescriptions

- Secure file sharing between patients and doctors.
- Generation of e-prescriptions (optional, depending on regulatory compliance).
- Session notes stored securely.

### 2.5 Notifications

- Email/SMS/Push notifications for appointment reminders.
- In-app notifications for waiting room status.

### 2.6 Analytics & Reporting

- Appointment history and usage statistics.
- System health metrics (uptime, latency, call quality).

## 3. Technical Architecture

### 3.1 Frontend (Vite + React/TS)

- Responsive UI (desktop & mobile).
- Multi-language support (EN/DE/FR).
- Accessible design (WCAG 2.1 compliance).

### 3.2 Backend (Node.js)

- REST API / GraphQL for core services.
- Signaling server for WebRTC (WebSocket-based).
- Appointment, user, and session management.
- Role-based access control.

### 3.3 Real-Time Communication

- **WebRTC** for video/audio.
- **STUN/TURN servers** (Coturn).
- **SFU (Selective Forwarding Unit)** via Mediasoup/Janus for group calls.

### 3.4 AWS Infrastructure

- **Compute**: ECS/EKS for containerized services.
- **Storage**: S3 + CloudFront for static assets & file exchange.
- **Database**: RDS (PostgreSQL) or DynamoDB for structured/unstructured data.
- **Auth**: Cognito (optional).
- **Security**: WAF + Shield for DDoS protection.
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch + custom logging.

## 4. Security & Compliance

- GDPR-compliant data processing.
- Data residency: EU regions (e.g., AWS Frankfurt or Zurich).
- TLS 1.2+ for all connections.
- End-to-end encryption for video sessions.
- Audit logs for access and activity tracking.
- Periodic third-party penetration testing & certification.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Scalability**: support up to 10,000 concurrent users initially, scalable via AWS autoscaling.
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime SLA.
- **Maintainability**: CI/CD pipelines, automated testing, modular codebase.
- **Extensibility**: API-first design for third-party integrations (e.g., payment, insurance systems).

## 6. Roadmap (High-Level)

1. **MVP (3-4 months)**

   - User management & appointments
   - 1:1 video consultation
   - Basic chat + file sharing
   - Secure authentication

2. **Phase 2 (6-8 months)**

   - Group consultations (SFU)
   - Virtual waiting room
   - Notifications (email/SMS/push)
   - Audit logging & analytics dashboard

3. **Phase 3 (12 months)**

   - E-prescriptions, e-certificates
   - Insurance/payment integration
   - AI-powered triage (optional)
   - Third-party compliance audits

## 7. Risks & Considerations

- **Regulatory compliance**: must ensure GDPR + healthcare-specific laws (e.g., KBV rules in Germany).
- **Security**: video data must never be stored unless legally required.
- **Performance**: high network demand in WebRTC â†’ must test across devices & bandwidths.
- **User adoption**: need intuitive UX for non-technical patients.

## 8. Success Criteria

- Secure, stable video consultations between doctors and patients.
- Compliance with GDPR and local medical standards.
- Positive feedback from practitioners and patients (>85% satisfaction rate).
- Scalability proven via load testing (10k concurrent users).
