# **Implement LiveKit for Real-Time Communication**

## **Overview: Purpose and Problem Solving**

* Our project requires stable realTimeVideo and realTimeAudio features to support collaboration between users.
* Building a custom webrtcServer is complex and time-consuming, while LiveKit provides tested sdkTools and serverInfra ready to use.

## **Proposal**

* Use LiveKit as the communication platform for videoCall, audioCall, and screenShare.
* Connect frontend with `livekitClient` and backend with token generation endpoint `getAccessToken`.

## **Weighting / Pros and Cons**

### **Pros**

* LiveKit is scalable and supports adaptiveStream and dynacast, which reduce bandwidth usage.
* Provides React components like `GridLayout`, `ParticipantTile`, and `ControlBar` to build UI faster.
* Security is built-in using signed accessToken with roomName and participantIdentity.
* Reduces development time compared to building and maintaining our own signaling system.

### **Cons**

* Adds dependency on a third-party service which increases monthly cost.
* The team needs time to learn LiveKit sdk and understand realTime media flows.
* Internet connection quality of users can affect performance, which we must handle in UI/UX.

## **Implementation Steps**

### **1. Setup backend token service**

* Create `/getToken` endpoint using `AccessToken(apiKey, apiSecret)` to generate secure token.

### **2. Connect frontend to LiveKit**

* Use `room.connect(livekitUrl, token)` and wrap components with `RoomContext.Provider`.

### **3. Enable media tracks**

* On join, call `room.localParticipant.setMicrophoneEnabled(true)` and `room.localParticipant.setCameraEnabled(true)`.

### **4. Render participants**

* Use `useTracks` hook and `<GridLayout>` with `<ParticipantTile trackRef={trackRef} />` to display users.

### **5. Handle room lifecycle**

* Call `room.disconnect()` on leave action or component unmount, and listen for `participantDisconnected` events.

## **Conclusion**

* LiveKit gives us a proven platform to handle video, audio, and data communication without building complex webrtc logic ourselves.
* It saves time, improves scalability, and allows the team to focus on core product features.
* I recommend moving forward with LiveKit integration to achieve reliable real-time collaboration.
