Hi [Client Name],

I read your job about integrating PayPal with your Node.js backend. I’ve done similar work for a small e-commerce store where I built a payment module using PayPal SDK.

I can start within 1 day and complete the integration with proper testing. You can check a similar demo I made here: github.com/yourname/paypal-demo.

Looking forward to working with you!
```

### 6. Communication Tips

Always confirm understanding: “Just to clarify, you want X, Y, and Z — correct?”

Break work into milestones and update regularly.

Over-communicate early, under-communicate later.

### 7. Handling Payments

Use escrow where possible (e.g., Upwork).

Never start unpaid test work unless it’s very small and agreed upon.

Ask for feedback after job completion to build profile reputation.

### 8. Build The Brand

Publish blogs, open-source contributions.

Create GitHub repos that solve real problems.

Record screen captures of you explaining your code.

### 9. Specialize Over Time

Start general, then narrow down. Examples:

API Developer for SaaS products

AWS Lambda + Serverless specialist

Developer for AI/ChatGPT integrations

🔥 Niche wins: Clients trust specialists more than generalists.

### 10. Create Repeat Business

Be on time, reliable, and communicate professionally.

Always leave room to ask: “Is there anything else I can help with?”

### 11. Quotes & Tips

> 💬 "You don’t need 100 clients — you just need 3–5 that love working with you."

> 🚀 Tip: Build 2–3 mini-projects or proof-of-concepts (POCs) and upload them to GitHub to showcase your capability.

> 💡 Highlight your strengths, such as **"I’m strong in debugging, fast delivery, and clear communication."**
