# ✅ Freelancer Task Checklist (Upwork / Remote Client)

_A step-by-step guide for receiving, preparing, working on, and delivering freelance tasks professionally._

---

## 🟢 1. Before Accepting the Task

### 🔲 Read the full job description carefully

> Make sure you understand:

- What is expected
- Deadline
- Output format (code, deployment, document, etc.)

### 🔲 Ask clarifying questions

> Example:

- What are the success criteria?
- Do you have design or API specs?
- Should I deploy or just send the code?

### 🔲 Check for technical feasibility

> Can I finish this with my current skills/tools?

### 🔲 Agree on:

- Timeline
- Milestones (if any)
- Communication channel (Upwork, Slack, email)
- Payment (fixed/hourly, upfront, milestones)

---

## 🧰 2. Task Setup & Preparation

### 🔲 Create a local folder or Git repo for the task

> Example: `client-task-login-feature/`

### 🔲 Save the original requirements somewhere (Notion, README)

### 🔲 Break down the task into sub-tasks (use Todo list)

### 🔲 Set up your dev environment

> Clone boilerplate, prepare Postman, Docker, etc.

### 🔲 Confirm timezone, daily/weekly update schedule

---

## 🛠️ 3. While Working on the Task

### 🔲 Use version control (Git)

- Make clear commits: `feat: add login endpoint`

### 🔲 Keep a change log (`changelog.md` or task notes)

- Helps with handover or future maintenance

### 🔲 Ask questions early if blocked (don’t wait too long)

### 🔲 Use real/test data for validation

### 🔲 Write clean, maintainable code

- Naming, comments, structure

### 🔲 Write basic test cases (unit/integration if needed)

---

## 📤 4. Delivering the Task

### 🔲 Prepare a final summary (to send to client)

```txt
✅ Task Summary:
- Added login endpoint with JWT
- Connected to PostgreSQL (RDS)
- Tested via Postman (login, invalid cases)

🚀 GitHub: https://github.com/yourname/client-login-task
```

🔲 Double-check delivery format:

- Code pushed?
- Live demo working?
- Docs or comments added?

🔲 Ask for feedback & rating if on Upwork
🧾 5. After Completion (Reflection)
🔲 Save the client’s feedback
Use for testimonials in portfolio

🔲 Archive code/tasks into personal folders
🔲 Reflect:

- What went well?
- What to improve (tech/communication/time)?

🔁 Optional Reuse Checklist

- Can I reuse this code in the future?
- Should I turn this into a GitHub demo/POC?
- Any part worth writing a blog or tweet about?

💬 "Freelancing = delivery + communication + consistency."
This checklist helps you avoid common beginner mistakes and shows professionalism even if you’re new.

### ✅ Gợi ý sử dụng:

- Bạn có thể in ra, pin lên Notion, hoặc tạo 1 project template dùng mỗi lần có task.
- Dùng nó làm "working standard" khi làm việc với khách hàng trên Upwork hay ngoài Upwork.
- Nếu dùng LangChain RAG, bạn có thể hỏi bot:
  - “What should I check before accepting a task?”
  - “How do I write a summary when submitting work?”
