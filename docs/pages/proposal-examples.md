# 💼 Proposal Examples for Freelance Developers (Upwork & Remote)

Use these as templates when applying to jobs — always **customize to fit the client’s need**, keep it short (100–200 words), and always show that you understand the task.

## 🧾 1. API Integration Task

> **Client Job**: “Need someone to integrate Stripe into my Node.js backend”

```txt
Hi [Client Name],

I’ve worked with Stripe and Node.js in multiple projects. Most recently, I built a checkout system for a small e-commerce platform using Stripe Payment Intents and Webhooks.

I can integrate your desired flow — payments, refunds, and webhook handling — in 1–2 days with clean, testable code.

Here’s a similar project I did: [GitHub link]

Let me know if you want a quick Zoom call to align on expectations.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
```

## 🧾 2. Bug Fix / Debugging Task

> **Client Job**: “Need help fixing a CORS error on my Express app”

```txt
Hi [Client Name],

That sounds like a common issue with Express CORS setup — I’ve handled this several times while working with frontend-backend apps using React and Node.js.

If you can give me access to your repo or error log, I’ll pinpoint and fix it quickly. I’m confident this can be solved within 1–2 hours.

Happy to help and explain the root cause so it won’t happen again.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

## 🧾 3. Long-Term Backend Support

> **Client Job**: “Looking for Node.js developer to maintain our backend”

```txt
Hi [Client Name],

I’d love to support your backend long-term. I have 6 years’ experience working with Node.js, PostgreSQL, Redis, and AWS. I’m comfortable maintaining APIs, improving performance, writing tests, and handling CI/CD pipelines.

I communicate clearly, keep detailed changelogs, and can adjust to your team’s workflow (Slack, Jira, GitHub, etc.).

Let’s start with 1 small task if you prefer a trial. I’m available ~20hrs/week and work best async.

Looking forward to collaborating!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
```

## 🧾 4. Fast One-Off Script

> **Client Job**: “Need a script to scrape data and send email report”

```txt
Hi [Client Name],

I can write a fast, efficient script in Node.js or Python to scrape your required data and send a formatted email report daily via SMTP or a service like SendGrid.

I’ve done similar automations before and can deliver within 1 day with easy-to-edit config.

Let me know the target website and output format, and I’ll get started.

Cheers,
[Your Name]
```

### ✅ Tips to Improve Your Proposals
