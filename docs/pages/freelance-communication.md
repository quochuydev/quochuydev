# 💬 Freelancer Client Communication Guide

### 📌 1. General Principles

- Always **confirm understanding**
- Keep messages short but informative
- Use bullet points when sharing updates
- Use the client’s tone (formal/informal, emojis if they use them)
- Over communicate at the start, under communicate later

### 📥 2. When You Receive a New Task

> 🔹 Your goal: Clarify scope, avoid assumptions

```txt

Just to confirm, here’s what I understand:
- [Point 1]
- [Point 2]
- Final output: [e.g., deployed API or zipped code]

Please let me know if I missed anything. Once confirmed, I’ll start right away.
```

### 💡 7. Communication Tools & Etiquette

| Tool       | Rule                                                        |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Upwork     | Use it for all messages/payments until trust is established |
| Email      | Use for long-form or official handovers                     |
| Slack/Zoom | Be clear, be on time, prepare a short agenda                |
| Voice call | Keep short, confirm with a follow-up message afterward      |

✅ Quick Reminders
Don’t ghost, even if you're stuck. Say something.

Don’t assume — ask questions.

Don’t wait for the deadline to update the client.

Don’t be too formal — be human.
