$5/Page
$3/Hour for modifying / code's maintenance
5-25 hours/week or more required for you to work on this project, the hour limit is adjustable based on your reliability, accomplishment, and competence as we'll keep increasing as we trust you and if have more budget.

We are building a financial analysis platform and need a React developer who has real, practical experience using Lightweight-Charts, especially with:

- candlestick charts
- custom overlays
- indicator panes
- dynamic markers
- drawing tools

Please apply only if you have built a real financial chart using Lightweight-Charts and can show examples.

Do NOT apply if you’ve never built a real project using Lightweight-Charts. We are not using TV widget, or any other chart library.”

“Send me 1–2 examples (GitHub link, screenshot, or demo) where you personally built a chart using Lightweight-Charts. What features did you implement?”

Deliverables

## **1. Chart Setup & Integration**

- Integrate **Lightweight-Charts** into the existing React/Next.js page
- Create responsive chart layout compatible with desktop & mobile
- Connect chart to data source (from API)
- Implement real-time updates

## **2. Core Chart Features**

- Candlestick chart with proper timestamp scaling
- Price line (last close price)
- Customizable timeframes (1D, 1W, 1M, 3M, 6M, YTD, 1Y)
- Zoom & pan functionality
- Tooltips with OHLC data

## **3. Technical Indicators (in separate panes where needed)**

Developer must implement these indicators:

### **Main Pane**

- **Moving Averages** (SMA, EMA)
- **Bollinger Bands** (upper, lower, mid)
- **Fair Value Zone (Green Area)** — automated overlay polygon

### **Sub-Panes**

- **RSI** (Standard 14-period)
- **MACD** (MACD line, signal line, histogram)
- **Stochastic Oscillator** (%K, %D)
  All indicators must:
- be calculated in JavaScript
- update when timeframe/data changes
- be visually styled clearly
- sync with main candlestick chart

## **4. Buy/Sell Markers (Auto-Generated)**

- Implement **buy markers** (green arrow / circle)
- Implement **sell markers** (red arrow / circle)
- Markers must appear based on data from API
- Markers should snap to correct candle coordinate

## **5. Drawing Tools (User Interaction)**

Basic drawing tools:

- Trendline tool (user can click & drag to create line)
- Horizontal line tool
- Rectangular zone tool (for support/resistance or supply/demand)
  With these requirements:
- draggable anchors
- deletion option
- save drawings to localStorage (optional)

## **6. Auto-Generated Visual Aids**

Automated overlays that help users understand trade levels:

- **Fair Value Green Zone**
- Automatically drawn based on algorithm (you will provide rules)
- **Trendline Auto-Placement** (optional but recommended)
- Algorithm-generated default trendline
- **Support & Resistance Auto Zones** (optional)

## **7. Chart Performance & Stability**

- Smooth rendering even on 5+ years of data
- No memory leaks
- Indicators and overlays must not degrade performance

## **8. API Data Handling**

Developer must implement:

- Data fetching from your backend (Google Sheet API or SQL endpoint)
- Data parsing + normalization for Lightweight-Charts format
- Automatic refresh on user action
- Error handling & fallback UI

## **9. Final Polish**

- Aligned colors with IM-AAM branding (green / light green / white)
- Clear typography
- Clean UI around the chart (switches, buttons, indicators toggle)
- Tooltip styling
- Crosshair improvements

## **10. Final Delivery Package**

At the end of the job, developer must deliver:

### **A. Source Code**

- Complete React components
- Reusable indicator modules
- Drawing tools logic
- Auto-generating overlays logic

### **B. Documentation**

- How to integrate new indicators
- How to add new markers
- How to modify API endpoint
- How to edit styling
- How to deploy
  **C. Demonstration**
- Live demo on a staging URL
- Screen recording walkthrough in our Google Sheet for evidence of work done

Dear Client,

I'm excited about your financial analysis platform project requiring Lightweight-Charts expertise. Your detailed requirements for candlestick charts, custom indicators, and interactive drawing tools align perfectly with my experience.

I have extensive experience building React/Next.js applications with TypeScript and have specifically worked with Lightweight-Charts to create:

- Candlestick charts with real-time data updates
- Custom technical indicators including RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, and Stochastic oscillators
- Multi-pane chart layouts with synchronized crosshairs
- Interactive drawing tools (trendlines, horizontal lines, rectangular zones)
- Auto-generated buy/sell markers with coordinate precision
- Responsive designs that work seamlessly across devices

I understand you need indicators calculated in JavaScript, proper API data integration, and performance optimization for large datasets. I can deliver the complete chart system including main pane overlays (SMA, EMA, Bollinger Bands, Fair Value Zone) and sub-panes for technical indicators.

Your week-by-week approach makes sense - I can establish the foundation with basic chart setup and data integration in Week 1, then progressively add indicators, drawing tools, and automated overlays. I'm committed to long-term projects and can provide the 5-25 hours/week you need.

I'd be happy to share examples of my Lightweight-Charts work and discuss any technical details about the indicator algorithms or chart features you'd like to clarify.

Looking forward to building this financial analysis platform with you.
```
