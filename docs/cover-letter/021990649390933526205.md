We are a real estate and construction–focused company building a next-generation online platform that combines the best parts of:

Zillow – home search and lead sales to real estate agents
HomeAdvisor – lead generation and resale to contractors
Yelp – business directory and customer reviews
Houzz – 3D design, contractor connection, and material sales

Our goal is to connect homeowners and property owners with contractors, designers, architects, engineers, realtors, and loan officers on a single platform.
Important (Platform Rule):
All communication and payments for this project must stay inside this platform.
Do not share or request email, phone, WhatsApp, social media, or any other external contact.
Proposals that try to move the conversation off-platform will be ignored and declined.

What We’re Building (High-Level Modules)
You will help design and build, in phases, a platform with:

1. Consumer Accounts (User & Homeowner)
   Two consumer roles with different access and pricing (User, Homeowner).
   Home listing and address verification.
   Cloud storage area for property documents.
   Ability to connect with service providers.
   Product / materials e-commerce (online store).
   Property search (buy/rent) similar to Zillow.
   3D home design tool using real construction materials and furniture.
   Access to games, podcasts, and online classes with quizzes and certificates.
   Architecture designed to be AI-compatible and self-learning ready.

2. Service Provider Platform
   Membership tiers with different access and pricing, for example:
   Workforce – workers looking for jobs and visibility.
   Pro – established businesses with full profiles, ability to bid on projects, buy homeowner leads, and connect with others.
   Hero – higher tier with ability to post projects, receive bids, and access a Project Finder tool.
   Realtors & Loan Officers – specialized memberships with CRM setup, bonus leads, and visibility to consumer users.
   Core service-provider features:
   Business directory with public profiles and ratings/reviews (Yelp-style).
   Project Finder – live feed of construction projects from permit data, searchable by contractors.
   Ability to post projects and receive bids from other contractors (GCs and subs).

3. CRM & Marketing Tools (Platform + Admin)
   Built-in CRM for service providers: pipelines, notes, tasks, reminders.
   Central admin CRM for our internal team (operations + sales).
   Integrated digital communication tools using external APIs:
   Phone dialer
   SMS campaigns
   Email campaigns
   Notification system (in-app + email/SMS).
   Responsibilities
   Work with the founders to convert the business plan into a phased technical roadmap.
   Architect and develop the web application, backend, and database for a multi-sided platform.
   Implement multi-tier memberships with subscription billing and access control.

Integrate or build:
CRM features (pipelines, notes, tasks, reminders)
Dialer / SMS / email capabilities via third-party APIs
E-commerce for materials
Course / LMS functionality (videos, quizzes, certificates)
Design admin tools for lead distribution, membership management, and reporting.
prepare the system for future modules (advanced AI assistant, 3D/AR, mobile apps).
Provide documentation and ongoing support after the MVP launch.

Requirements
5+ years in full-stack web development with marketplace and/or SaaS products.
Strong in at least one modern stack, for example:
Frontend: React / Next.js / Vue / Nuxt
Backend: Node.js / NestJS / Laravel / Django / Rails

Real estate or construction tech platforms
City/open-data APIs (permits, property data)
3D or AR design tools
Telephony/SMS APIs (Twilio or similar)
AI tools (e.g., OpenAI, LLM-based assistants)
Engagement
Project Type: Long-term, multi-phase build (starting with MVP).
Contract: Fixed-price or hybrid (fixed milestones + hourly support, depending on scope).

Start Date: As soon as the right partner is selected.

How to Apply

## Cover Letter

```
Hello! I'm excited about your real estate and construction platform project. Your task description is very clear, especially the detailed vision for combining Zillow, HomeAdvisor, Yelp, and Houzz features into a comprehensive multi-sided platform.

With 7 years of full-stack development experience, I've built similar complex marketplaces and SaaS products. For your platform, I recommend a modern stack: Next.js/React for frontend with TypeScript, Node.js/NestJS for backend APIs, PostgreSQL for structured data with Redis for caching, and AWS for scalable infrastructure. This architecture supports your AI-ready requirements and multi-tier membership system.

My 60-90 day MVP plan focuses on delivering tangible value quickly:

**First Week (12 hours) - Foundation Setup:**
- Setup Next.js 14 + TypeScript project structure with monorepo architecture
- Configure Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL, design database schema for all user roles
- Implement JWT authentication with role-based access control (RBAC)
- Create API foundation with user registration/login endpoints
- Set up development environment with Docker and CI/CD pipeline

**Weeks 2-4 - Core User Features:**
- Build user profile system for all 7 user types (Free User, Homeowner, Workforce, Pro, Hero, Realtor, Loan Officer)
- Implement property listing and address verification workflow
- Create service provider directory with search and filtering
- Set up subscription tiers with Stripe integration

**Weeks 5-8 - Platform Features:**
- Build CRM tools for service providers (pipelines, notes, tasks)
- Implement project bidding system and lead management
- Create admin dashboard for lead distribution and reporting
- Add notification system (email/SMS) using Twilio and SendGrid

**Weeks 9-12 - Testing & Launch:**
- Security audit and performance optimization
- User testing and bug fixes
- Documentation and deployment preparation
- MVP launch with monitoring setup

I have experience building CRM systems and multi-sided marketplaces, including payment integrations and subscription management. There are some fields about the specific 3D design requirements I'd love to understand better, and I hope we can work and discuss them together.

I'm available 4-6 hours daily overlapping with North American business hours. As an individual developer, I can offer competitive hourly rates or discuss fixed-price milestones for the MVP.

I'd be happy to share my portfolio links to similar platforms I've built.
